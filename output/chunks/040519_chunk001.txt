Brett

There. Ryan did had this wonderful idea. He's listening to me gabble on and. He said. But

you don't understand the 101 stuff that you're delivering to Cody is gold. And he says, we

need to. Record all these moments and put them up on our our. Our sight. So he's going to.

Somehow figure it all out. I've gotta do my hair from now on so that. And. Edit them or

whatever so. You do you. Hopefully you don't mind.

Cody

No, I don't mind. I'm bummed we haven't been recording the whole.

Brett

Time. Yeah, well, that's what Brian ringing it was Ryan to you. So. Alright, buddy. So things

are looking up. You're feeling more confident this week.

Cody

Yep. Numbers are better I am.

Brett

Any any reason that you're thinking?

Cody

I have absolutely no idea. You know, we got more stocking, but I don't, I don't think that's it.

I I just think it's kind of random. We've had a couple. Repeat customers come in. There's

this one woman who's I think the head of digital at Discovery Channel who comes in two or

three times a week and spends a couple 100 bucks and brings a new person from her

office every time. So that's been great. And then.

Brett

Yes.

Cody

I don't, I don't know the. I mean, it's just kind of ran. So.

Brett

Yeah, well, don't lose sight of the fact that yes, it is random. Depending on the people in the

center and but retail is also enormously consistent, inconsistently consistent is the way to

think about it. And sometimes energy and activity, even though you say, oh, we've got new

stock in. But if that's caused the team. To be remerchandising and doing stuff, you'd be

surprised how energy attracts energy and activity pulls people in subconsciously.

Cody

Yeah, but the other strange thing is that my perception of it was that things were really

slow. But at the end of the day. The. Numbers looked great yesterday. I was just, you know.

Banging my head against the wall because I thought we weren't going to hit our target. No

one was coming in and then? No, it just changes instantly within 2 seconds. You have a

crowd of people in you, hit your numbers and everything is done. It's just.

Brett

Yeah, that's right now. Yes.

Cody

It's just amazing and it's visible and fascinating and.

Brett

Yes. Yeah, it actually helps having these conversations because you you actually bring

back for me things that you know, I now just take for granted that I I also learned those

things well. Never give up because in the last five minutes somebody will come in and 500

bucks and bang and every you never know when that customer. Which person is going to

be that? That one? Yeah. All right. Your agenda, buddy.

Cody

All right, so we've talked about sales. We finally got the website up. It's exciting.

Brett

Any files?

Cody

No, I haven't told anyone about it. Uh, but yeah, we we'll start to slowly roll that out, start

talking about it again. We have to figure out process because. You know the the team

needs to grab the product off the store. We don't, we don't have anywhere to put it in the

store. Because we don't have any space or storage, so we're just figuring out where we can

put the bags of products so that we can fulfill them at the end of the day. Any advice there

or?

Brett

Yeah, me get started. Get the orders and then you'll figure it out. That's. That's the way to

do that. You you're anticipating a problem and if we you think about it this way and if if we

get one or two orders, you don't have a problem that you need to even think about if we get

slammed then that's a champagne problem, we'll, we'll we'll find a, we'll find a solution.

And because you're it's so small and nimble, if we screw up, you can get on the phone to a

customer or e-mail directly or WhatsApp whatever and and and it won't be a screw up,

you'll actually turn it into a A, you know, a screw up into a positive. Whether that means

you gotta personally deliver it or ship it into a UPS bag for free, you. There's just nothing you

can do wrong. At the moment, but be conscious that we do need to set up. Systems that

will. Work but. Let's get it going. You can't launch a site and not tell anybody that it's there.

Cody

Well, yeah, I gotcha. We we launched it yesterday afternoon. So I'm going to push some

traffic there today.

Brett

Yeah. Loving it.

Cody

Yeah, there was a funny example yesterday of what you're talking about. I I was there were

four or five customers in the store. My team member went on her lunch break. I was kind of

cross selling multiple at one time and checking another person out. And I ended up putting

the wrong person's products. Into the bag of the customer that was leaving, but luckily I I

had her e-mail address and shot her a note and got on the phone and said hey, if you're in

the mall, do you mind coming back or I'll happy to meet you somewhere. And ended up she

was working in the building next door, so she never got back or ran over and got the

products. Everything was OK, but it was it was.

Brett

Funny. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's when we're 100 stores. And that **** happens, it causes.

It's a real issue. When you're 1 store and you, you know that they're just moments to

embrace a customer even further. All right.
