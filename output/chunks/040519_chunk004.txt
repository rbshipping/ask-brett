Speaker

It's.

Brett

A. It's a game that gets played regularly. It's fun. You gotta look at it. It's fun.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

But one day you'll get to the stage where you can just write a note that says dear valued

supplier.

Cody

I can't wait. All right.

Speaker

Yeah.

Cody

Amazing. Hey, one of the companies who wants to try us. Yeah, they want to be in the

store. I want to try them out. Agreed to a consignment deal or they would put. Have you

ever done anything? Like that, Charlie Joe.

Brett

It's a consignment. It's a wonderful thing.

Speaker

I'm.

Brett

Ah. And you can track it yourself so that. Yeah, you should absolutely. The reason I love

consignment 11 is you don't pay until you've sold it, but when somebody comes in with

consignment, they genuinely think their product is going to. Is good and they. They know

they're gonna get paid for occasionally. You'll find people that offer consignment. They've

got this disaster that they're just trying to ship. We've gotta we've gotta, we've gotta. Get

something somehow so. But genuinely that that's usually they. They believe in their

product.

Cody

Yeah. All right, great.

Speaker

What?

Brett

By the way.

Cody

It's called Lake and sky. It's it's this. Honestly, it's just a. Ruan and a candle. So one of a

million things. With the citizens.

Brett

Yeah, yeah.

Cody

Designed for stress relief. Yeah. Perfect. I'm a little hesitant because we already have a

bunch of that stuff, but I'm willing to try it. What happens?

Brett

Yeah.

Cody

See.

Brett

Well, the loss is all wrong man.

Speaker

Right.

Cody

All right, so let's talk for a second about location 2, Joe. Couple of things here is had a very

funny moment couple days ago. This guy walks in. He's looking at the product. You can

always kind of tell that. He's not really a customer, but he he's curious what's going on in

walks in this other woman beelines it straight towards me in the back. Introduced herself

as the head of leasing at Mace Ridge for Santa Monica. Place wants to talk to me. She

heard all about us. She wants us to go into the. Store. I said great and walk out with her. I

come to find out the guy that was in there was the head of leasing for Westfield that I hadn't

met yet. And it was a great, great little moment. It's a good signal for him to see his

competitor come in and and want us to to be in at their.

Speaker

Well.

Brett

I mean, great lucky moment, great lucky moment.

Cody

Yeah. Yeah, fun, fun, little moment there. Sure. So Santa Monica Place is pushing for us

really hard. They they want us and then. Some people from their specialty leasing team got

connected to me through a different way and and they're talking about having us. They feel

like there's a huge shortage of really interesting and small items like our store in Santa

Monica place that they're interested in. The tourist piece. They think there's a lot of traffic

there that might be really compelling for us, especially if families. Tourists. They're pushing

health in a big way. I told him I don't want to. Be on the second floor. And they played with a

couple of options. So a few things to look at there. I I sent you the e-mail that she sent me.

See that? That so there's there's one space. There's two spaces, 1 is a 100 square foot

kiosk that I'm not interested in. I don't think that's a good move for us if if we wanted to just

have a little presence there and see what happens, might be interesting, but. OK.

Brett

But I I think you've already. You've already got that right. Santa Monica and Century City

different, but similar. Yeah. And you know that 300 square feet is hard for us to keep the

energy going. 100. It's just. Yeah, it's gonna be. I don't think we need to test that. The more

water, I agree.

Cody

So this there's this 3000 square foot spot where.

Brett

I can say that there's big.

Cody

They may be willing to block off the 1st 1000 feet and just rent us the 1st 1000 feet. Really.

Yeah. The The thing is, I don't think it would be a long term lease. It would be another year

or until just after the holidays, which may be interesting. You know the issue is we can't,

we're again in pop-up mode. We're not really investing in the space. Our fit out would be a

little temporary and I think the one caveat, which is probably a deal breaker is that if they

find a bigger tenant, they'll kick us out. And they'd have the right to do that. So. Again. Just

wanted to show you that option. It's a pretty good location in the mall on the 1st floor. It

might be interesting to explore depending on what the economics are. If they give it to us at

a huge discount might be worth.

Brett

But you are right, if if they do all that, that's cool. You can so you get. This is one of those

times. You get around their side of the desk. They've got 3000 square feet. Which they can

get full value on for somebody that wants 3000 square feet, why would they give? Why

would they? Can burn 1000. They don't want to even five years from now, when the lease

comes around, they'll then go well. You've either got to pay the whole freight. Now. Right

now we don't much care about five years from now. But these things we will care about.

So. If they. And it's really hard to do it in America doing a temper, A pop-up store. You've
