rent and.

Cody

Yeah. Well, it's less. Less than what we're paying century City.

Brett

Yeah, yeah, but remember, we're overpaying there because of. Yeah, you know, don't think

don't set the bar on that rent. We're never gonna ship like we can't pay that sort of.

Cody

Rent anywhere you do need to figure out what what a good dollar per square foot target is.

Brett

Let me let me turn that around. Because what you've gotta do is figure. Out what? We're

gonna turn on. And then work it back. Forget this market rate stuff. There is a market rate

where, but now that you've got some understanding, you start to go. Yeah, we can. We'll

get 15 grand out of that that place. Therefore we can afford to pay.

Cody

Right.

Brett

So really, the only measure that matters.

Cody

So how do you calculate do? Do you assume in four and 300 square feet now do you

assume in 1000 square feet we'll? Do 3X revenue. We'll do 50% more. I mean, what do you

how do you calculate that?

Brett

And I think. It's a bit complicated at the moment because we need to get more products in,

so we'll we'll we'll we'll have a deeper depth and broader offering which should attract

more. Now you're not sure yet that we're able to, we're able to do that. I'm certain that that

will happen in time. But there's no doubt that. We should be. If you wanted to, you could

take the turnover per square metre and then just apply it on the basis that we'll get the

same in 1200 square feet. Now the unknown for us at the moment is what size our offering.

Should be. You know there is a there. Is a size where. You're worried we can't fill 1200 so?

Cody

Yes.

Brett

If it's, if it's only 600, but we've got to be able to fill 1200, I think. To make this work. In

which case you would be able to go times it by three would be. The right number. Now that

won't work on our current turnover. We have to get it back up to sort of 11,000, yeah,

because it simply city is a high turnover place where when you succeed. If so, for example,

honey, the debt, there's no way known we'll expect to do in in Brea. The turnover that we're

you know the 2530 grand we're doing. In Century City, it will be a 20 grand turnover store.

Type stuff. That'll. That'll come with time that. I think you've got enough info to roughly do

that in your head rather than trying to think out well what's the rate, because by now you

know they're all thieves. They won't tell you what the real. Yeah, they're just trying to figure

out. They always flatter you. What are your margins? How much are you turning over? Ohh,

tell me, how's the CBD stuff going? Ohh, what? How much of the store that they're trained

in getting him from. And they're only they're not interested. In you regretfully. They're

interested in how much can I get out? Is this offering? Good. And then how much can I get?

Out of you.

Cody

Yeah, yeah.

Brett

Yep, it's a nasty old world. This business world isn't.

Cody

It. Yeah, it's, it's fun. It's a good game. So I I had a chat with Lovisa folks. I forget her name.

She was visiting century City.

Brett

Beatrice Kim.

Cody

I think it was Kim.

Brett

Yeah. Yeah. She Ozzy. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Cody

And she had mentioned, you know, with the visa, whether they're in 700 feet or 1000, they

still do roughly the same turnover. It doesn't matter fact. They prefer to be in less because

of that exact reason. I'm just wondering if our business will be similar or not.

Brett

And I hope not so to to take Levisa. It has the example LEVISON'S model is is 506 hundred

square feet. That is the ideal. That we have and that's worked out the same way as we're

trying to work it out that if you go bigger, you don't get anymore. If you put in more range

and part of that is that we have to have it small so that the intensity of the product is

dramatic. So that you you do. Work out and it's the same thing with honey Burdette, and it's

a small because. If we push it out any further it it pollutes. We we can't, we can do a lot

more in lingerie you can go into sports and you can go into T-shirt bras but that then

destroys what what we are the bras and things model which is in the laundry business. It

was a 200. A 2000 square foot. That's so every every business that you look at and you'll

find. That it's got the all. The the size that. Where? The J curve. Is and we haven't yet figured

that out. What I do know it is that a 50 square M in this. Product. A50 Square, a 500 square

foot store. Won't work.

Speaker

For us.

Brett

It has to. Get to that 800-1200 or even. Yeah, and it as as we begin to expand, it might even

be a, a, a bigger now bigger is better. In terms of retail, but don't don't get confused our our

footwear businesses, for example, have 300 square, 3000 square feet stores. It just we we

have to find that. But we keep think bigger is. Better. Wider product, deeper offering, better

for productivity, better for better, for getting locations. The rents are cheaper on bigger

sites. So keep that as the strategic thing.

Cody

I was better, but that's a good reframing. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker

OK.

Cody

All right, so there are two Santa Monica options. Fashion Island is being a little tricky. I
