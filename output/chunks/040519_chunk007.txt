sites. So keep that as the strategic thing.

Cody

I was better, but that's a good reframing. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker

OK.

Cody

All right, so there are two Santa Monica options. Fashion Island is being a little tricky. I

made contact with her. She then emailed me back saying I'm actually going to be at

Century City tomorrow. Ohh, I said. Wonderful. Come check out the store. Let's chat. She

didn't respond, I guess went in first thing in the morning when my opener was there. Left

her card. I wasn't there to see her, and then I followed up. I called her and followed up e-

mail wise and haven't heard anything yet. So.

Brett

Yeah. The the Fashion Island people are very. Up themselves, they're very they love to tell

you that no, it wouldn't work here or no, you're you're not high enough priced or you're not.

Blah blah blah.

Cody

Yeah. Other than other than that, I mean the the other two are Glendale and Del Amo. And

I've just been holding off because I I don't feel like that's a great #2 store for us. I'm not. I'm

not sure where else to look. I'll talk to a broker agent to think about some of the off mall

streets, but again, I'm pretty hesitant on those two.

Brett

You're such a snob, man. You're such a Santa Monica snow.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

You don't think people out in Glendale are anxious and stressed?

Cody

I think they are. I just don't think there are as many people that are going to drop the 200

four, $100 purchases at the store.

Brett

Zoom move.

Cody

I'm not sure we've refined our model enough yet to be able to support the volume.

Brett

Yeah. Alright, it's uh.

Cody

But look. Again, if we if we did go open there, it would kind of force us to figure it out and

and we would have to refine it. I just don't want to get locked into a five year lease. In the

wrong place. If if that's, that ends up being the case, I I feel like knowing what I know now,

the Del Amo property, the store that we. Were looking at. In particular on that secondary.

Brett

Yeah.

Cody

I don't think that would have worked very. Well.

Brett

Yeah.

Cody

It's probably a.

Brett

Good, good decision.

Cody

Could have worked on the main strip, where I think Lavista just opened up, but yeah.

Brett

Yep. Anyway. They'll be back. Trust me. They'll be back to us in some way, yeah. Mean

more. More importantly, how you're coping with the fact that these little ***** tell you

when, when and they will and won't work?

Cody

Yeah. It's. It's just ridiculous. I mean, it's it's ridiculous.

Brett

Hmm.

Cody

Because they just don't know. At all. But you know we will push forward and figure it out,

yeah.

Brett

I mean, it kills me that the pain that you go through with this stuff and everybody goes

through it. So there's two couple of things that are happening that I can share with you. It is

a problem that has slowly got worse over the years because millennials being millennials

who. Or whatever they are now ex generation. Are so used to I do what I want to do when I

want to do it and. You work around me. Which? Is on one hand great when you're trying to

run A and roster a store. It's a disaster. Second thing is you won't like me saying this, but it

is 100% true. You get that? In suburbs like Beverly Hills and centres like Century City?

Yeah, because. They're full of very confident cocky. People that don't need the money and

have lives and have mothers and fathers and that go. What do you mean you're gonna miss

this opportunity because you've got your $12.00 an hour job and they get.

Speaker

It's it's a.

Brett

Killer. And it's so frustrating when great people because those people can be the best

because they are motivated, they are of good character and. But their their work and their

job is secondary. It's it's just secondary. Sometimes it's 3rd or 4th. Down the down the line.

Fine.

Cody

Were you sorry to interrupt? Are you talking about the part timers talking? OK, gosh, we

gotcha. Yeah. Yes, extremely annoying.

Brett

Yeah, the part times. Not.

Cody

God, what it means? It's just ridiculous because. They. Part timers so they dictate when

they're available, rather than the alternate being true. Yeah. Anyways, OK, now I'm on the

same.

Brett

Page sorry I jumped to. So what I want to share with you that this is normal normal.

Speaker

Now time.

Brett

It is exaggerated in centres where the higher. It just and it doesn't matter. Whether it's in

the UK, whether it's in Sydney. You can pick them and you know where we have most

people where we have most people problems. You do have to overcome it by. Number one,

getting up. Front we need you to work on this, this and this day. Can you commit? You need

to put it in. Writing. They need to sign it off, and even then it won't work. But they need at

least it helps move forward. You have the honest conversation with them and then

someone go ohh you. Look I did. Thomas Cody. And then that if they're unreliable, then that

that's a box you have to tick because they know how good somebody is. If they're

unreliable, you need to you take a lesser person who's more reliable in the long run. That's.

That's how it. That's how it works. Just the nature of it. You have to be brutal on it. We need

you when we need you and if. You can't show up. You can't show up now. They'll try and
