That's how it. That's how it works. Just the nature of it. You have to be brutal on it. We need

you when we need you and if. You can't show up. You can't show up now. They'll try and

say, but I've rung. I've rung Billy and Billy is going to come in instead. Well, I didn't want

Billy. I wanted you. You know type.

Speaker

Right.

Brett

Stuff so a little bit of flexibility, but there you get to at the moment where you've got nobody.

Now right now you can fill the hole, but if you. Couldn't fill that hole.

Cody

And.

Speaker

Yeah, the store doesn't.

Brett

Open. So it's just, it's just a people. Yeah. Welcome to the world of managing people. And

and that's where discipline and standards and and letting them know how. How when do

you put the rosters out and when do you give them, are we doing it at week in advance?

Cody

Yeah, it's about a week in advance. I wanted to get to 2 weeks, but it's just been too hard

with too many moving.

Brett

Parts. So yeah, and and it's much better to sort of get it out Thursday night for the next

week that that works best for you. Yeah, and. They've got to now the other way to do it is

you will be working unless you tell me you can't and you request time off. You we you don't

take it, you request.

Speaker

It but.

Brett

It is. It is much harder.

Cody

Yeah. I mean, these are, like you said, they're Beverly Hills kids with their families going on

vacation. You know they're. Going on camping trips over the weekend just to. There is no.

Requesting they just say I'm not going to.

Brett

Be here. Yeah. Yeah, and. And what you're trying to do is teach them discipline and so on.

But that's why it's better not to. I promise you, we all come to the conclusion that it's better

not to employ them when they're there. They're great. But they're they're unreliable. Yeah,

it's a. It's a big shame that but there. They do the parents while we're going camping. So

you're coming. Well, well, I've got work and and the parent goes what? The 100 bucks that

you're gonna earn in that in that. We're going camping.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

Doing untold damage.

Cody

In in a situation where. I mean literally 3 of my. Poor people that I have working through the

week are gone. In two weeks, I mean, do I attempt to hire as many more people as I can?

Do I fly my mom out again to come work? Do I? Just figure. I mean is there a temp agency

used to bring?

Brett

The the moment you use temp agencies that you are our business is doomed the the there

is no answer to this other than you employed the wrong people. So you've gotta go and beg

them and then you you actually. Have to fire them and start again because. So. You've got

to tell them the problem. Hey, guys, are employed, you guys. You can't all be away. One of

you has to figure it out. Now. You you've got to go that hard because. I can't operate this

business without knowing that you're going to be. Available.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

Now if they then all say, well, I can't, then one of them will feel sorry for you. One of them

will be looking good and feeling like they want to be a part of this. One of them didn't want

to go camping anyway. There there will. There will be an answer, but what you don't want to

have is this constant. I've gotta spend 3 hours a week trying to figure out because you guys.

Think you're beyond all this you need. Then you've gotta find people that. Don't go camping.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

That's why, out of Glendale, it's much easier. They don't go camping as much. They don't

travel to Europe. I'm sorry. I'm going to Europe. Isn't that all exciting? And they come in. Oh,

it's so exciting. I gotta get. No, that's not exciting. But then get it up front so the the

proactive is always the way you've gotta get it upfront in the stuff you sign when you're

interviewing them. You don't just sit them down, fill them into a seat that I need you. When

will you be? What's your availability? And and then the first question you ask is what's your

availability? And I'm going to need you there. And then you've got to ask because you

cannot employ everybody that's doing exams at the same time, right?

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

If you've got three people on that, all have to take the two weeks off. That exams happen at

whatever time that happens in the US, then you're doing. So you learn these things as as

you go.

Cody

Yes.

Brett

And then you ask them up front and they go well. I can't. And if they say, well, I can and

then the first time that they that they come and say I can't come you say, you know Billy, I

employed you, I asked you, you signed it here. Do you want me to go get the form and go

yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry Cody. I'm sorry. Rob, I'm sorry, doesn't cut it. You gotta help me

out. You promised. You made this and you? Are you playing? On that emotion. But that's

proactive about how it is. We need you when we need you. And if you can't be available. I

I'd love to give you the job, but I can't. You know, half of them will say, well, sorry, I don't

care. I'll go get a job somewhere else. Yeah, sorry, buddy. There's no answer to that. But
