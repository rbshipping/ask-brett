I'd love to give you the job, but I can't. You know, half of them will say, well, sorry, I don't

care. I'll go get a job somewhere else. Yeah, sorry, buddy. There's no answer to that. But

again, I want you to know that every retailer in Century City has this problem.

Speaker

Yes.

Cody

Yeah. Yeah, my my issue is I don't have. I don't have a pipeline of backups. You know, if I

fire my main full timer. I'm kind of **** out of luck until I find another one who can do it so.

Brett

And I know. But listen, you've got to balance these things, but this is a new this is the way

that you learn this stuff. Is that who it there's. There's a thing that you get in your head and.

Are you running? Are you running the roster or is the roster running you? Yeah. Are you

running the store or is the store running you and the moment that you answer that question

in that it's being run by some, is the team running you or are you running the team? The

moment you go, all the teams running me, which is what's happening in this issue, that's

the disaster. It's an accident waiting to happen. And then you gotta make the hard

decisions and pull it back. You work when I need you. And if you can't do that, I don't want

you because the business will ultimately suffer. Now, that doesn't solve your immediate

crisis. That's, but that's that's the way you've got to think of when you can ask that in at

every level at all the. Time. Is the is the store running you or are you running the store?

That's always a question of managing the. Are you running the business or is the business

running you? Who's setting the agenda? Are you setting the agenda or is the agenda? Been

set for you.

Speaker

Ah.

Brett

In the moment that's around the wrong way and there there's that moment right, there is a

moment right there, Ryan. That for this recording you told me to tell you when I had a

moment that. Was one of them. All right, buddy. Sorry. You know, I'm good at giving advice.

I can't come down there. And fix it for you.

Cody

No, I I got you. I got you. I'll figure it out. I always do.

Brett

Yes, you do, and that's why you're an entrepreneur.

Cody

Yeah. All right, well.

Brett

Alright honey now.

Cody

Just.

Brett

I may or may not be talking to you next week.

Speaker

But.

Cody

You're in Europe, right?

Brett

I am in, in. I'm in your mean. Actually the X price and then doing. Store visits in France and

UK.

Cody

So I'm not going to talk to you for about two weeks.

Brett

Yeah, but like you remember, call me WhatsApp me anytime 24/7 with my phone. I don't

have my phone on when I'm asleep, so you'd never, never have fear of. That.

Cody

Do you want the? Do you still like getting the daily?

Brett

Sales love, love it. Never stop.

Cody

OK. Last question. Easter Sunday most stores are closing, are we are we closed? We open.

What's the? I got a note from the mall asking what we wanted to do.

Brett

America never shuts down. Now I've never. Heard of that?

Speaker

Wow.

Brett

What's typical in? What's typical in the in the states not forget the centre?

Cody

I I actually have no idea cause I. Never go shopping on Easter or doing something. But yeah,

people will go to church that day. I don't. I don't really. I have no idea. I can ask around.

Brett

The the essentially be opened all the time, but if the centre is closed then the centres

closed but. You certainly want to experiment. You know, remember when the the whole

place was shut down because of that bomb thing that that and you look what happened

that night you got.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

We did all right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
