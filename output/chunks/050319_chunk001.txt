Brett

Ohh buddy. Sorry Nellie forgot you. Hi, can you hear me?

Cody

There we go. That was OK.

Brett

Yeah, you're muted. You're muted.

Cody

It was muted.

Brett

Yeah. Nice. Yeah. Good to see you again. Quick as a flash because. We spent too long

together the other day. Ah.

Cody

I'll take anytime I can get.

Brett

You're a good man. How'd you go, Steven?

Cody

Ohh great. We had a great conversation. Yeah, I appreciated it. I think he.

Brett

Next.

Cody

Said typically he wants to do that before.

Brett

Yeah, yeah, typically and in in the right structure, he would he would be with you a day or

two beforehand. Yeah. That's that's the way we we do that. Alright man, let's zoom through

this so.

Cody

Yeah, really not. Not too much to talk about since since yesterday but. We have a couple of

quick items here.

Brett

Yeah.

Cody

It's a snapshot of sales this week. Get a little slow, haven't broken 1000. Yeah.

Brett

That's.

Cody

Working on it.

Brett

That is. That these things are a concern, the Sundays are, you know, big concern, isn't it?

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

Usually when you get that sort of drop off, it's related to. The what's something wrong with

the team? Well. Because that's too inconsistent. I but. Friday, Saturday, you got to pull off

some big days. Don't.

Cody

You we do. What? How would you look into that? Something off with the team?

Speaker

So.

Cody

My best people on on Sunday.

Brett

Yeah. With the numbers. So here's one of the things if the numbers numbers never lie.

That's just a. Bedrock thing. Even though you want to justify them, you know it's raining.

There was no people in the. Center to to, to, to, to.

Speaker

Yeah.

Brett

You know, 600 bucks on the, you know, what is proving to be. The. 2nd busiest day. You

usually. You usually want to look. At. People now, how do you do that, man? This is why we

check up. You're very close to it, so you should be able to see it. You had your best people

on, but were they having an off day? Were they not serving anybody and they just couldn't

give a ****. And and in a small store like that, if someone's. Cranky and angry. And, you

know, just sending the wrong vibe and people that don't come that only want to come in.

Now that can happen. But just put that in the back of your head. I think, yeah.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

As you get bigger. And you, you don't know the individuals, the numbers dry. Have we're

down here 20% when you've got another network and everybody else isn't down 20%, then

you just know it's the people. Yeah, it it gets easier and that's why I can say that with such

confidence that generally that's what happens. Alright.

Cody

The other thing to note. This. You know transaction volume. Was up there 25. But this is

what it looks like when we don't have one or two big. Purchases. Yeah. Yeah, you know.

Brett

So you know that that's a good point. That's that's a good point to consider that we did have

the customers, they were just all small. So therefore it might be get get the selling ability.

So the customers are there but they couldn't be bothered working with them. I mean, it

doesn't. It doesn't make it exactly right, but these things exercise your mind. Why? The

more you think about it, and the more you realise there are patterns and the more that you

get one day you'll get to the point of saying just what I said it is usually normally always.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

People related. Yeah. Now of course. There's 100% times when it isn't just bad day. We

didn't get anybody in it did.

Cody

Yeah, this was the same team that did the biggest Saturday ever. The day before at 3300.

So it's just. Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

Brett

It happens.

Speaker

Now.

Brett

We. Just shifted. Don't. Don't worry too much. It is more the purpose of these calls to. Get

it in your head.

Cody

Yep, Yep.

Brett

Doesn't necessarily need any committed action.

Cody

Yeah. All right, so quick hits here. We had our first little shoplifting incident yesterday.

Brett

Yeah.

Cody

I think the team was a little freaked out that.

Speaker

Yeah.

Cody

They would be in trouble, but at some point there's nothing you can do. I mean this person

literally right behind them, stuff stuff in their bag. Have the video if you're interested in

seeing it. But yeah, our our policy, I guess is. All about customer experience. Don't

approach, don't engage unless you really know.

Brett

No, no, no, no, no. My 100% engaged. So here's the thing it that's what I want to talk about

it that it won't be your first shoplifting experience. It's the first one you've. You've seen and

that's important element of this in terms of training. So this is. These are the sort of things

that which we now write about. So in your weekly communication to the team, yeah, we

had a shoplifting experience. Cause here's the way that you you handle this. And so first of

all, you tell them it's kind of happened from time. To time. And you drive, you take every

opportunity. You always need to drive customer engage and customer focused customer

service. Because that is 100% the way to limit shoplifting, the shrinkage involved in

shoplifting where customers these these aren't customers. So that's not calling customers

dishonest people trying to steal from us, which do exist in. The world progressively. Now. If

we shoplifters just like any other criminals. They go to. Lengths to figure out where and how
