think about it?

Cody

Yeah. So I have two questions, so. In the case that you approach someone and say, hey,

can I help you with that or can I put that on the counter while you shop and they just say no

or ignore you or get aggressive? What is the the next? We can be communicate.

Brett

So if they if they get aggressive, it's a judgment call. Leave it the we're not putting our team

in any where. We want to escalate aggressive behaviour. Now. On the other side, there is

no, you know, no, I didn't. No, I'm. Sorry I didn't do that. Well, let me have a look. So you

just say, well, I'm sure that that go in, it must have went in there by accident. So this is what

your role? Play. So. So let's have a look. If someone says no, you can't look in there. Then

you you, technically, legally, they haven't shoplifted. They haven't stole until. They've

walked out the door. That's a.

Speaker

It's.

Brett

Important point. So you can't accuse anybody of anything till they've walked out and left

without paying if they're still in the store, that's all they had. They just had every intention of

you grab them, you open it up. Well, remember, these are shoplifters. They're they've

thought about this. This is not.

Cody

Yes.

Brett

And. Well, yeah. So yeah, I was of course I was. Intending to pay for it. The police won't. The

police won't even charge you that alone. Get it? Get it to a. Get it to a court. The moment

they step outside of the store then then you. If you let me see in that bag then if they start

running as you know there there's videos everywhere. You've already got the video of this

guy. So you've got to report it and the police will very rarely do anything about minor.

Shoplifting, it's just. Too hard in California, they don't. They just front up to a court and they

get told, you know, don't do it again. It takes, you know, a lot of shoplifting before you. So

the police are wholly uninterested. But that doesn't mean you don't call them. Yeah, you

have to. Do. That we just have to do that. So we're sending them a message that that we

got. You. So does that make sense? It depends. You must legally. You are allowed to ask

somebody to open their bag. Different countries, and I don't know what it is in California,

you can't actually dig. Through their personal stuff.

Cody

But you can look in it interesting.

Brett

You can't physically touch anybody. But if you're being reasonable and they run. Then.

They're already incriminating themselves. So and then, you know, honest people. Know

that videos are running everywhere.

Cody

Yeah, yeah.

Brett

And.

Cody

I mean, this person was staring at the camera half the time, which is hilarious.

Brett

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker

Yes.

Brett

There we go. So that that help. And So what I what I really wanted to tell you from this is

that shoplifting is a part of it. It's how we do it and how we handle it and how there are ways

to minimise.

Speaker

It.

Brett

And that puts us ahead competitively makes us better, better at operating people. The

general rules are do not get in harm's way, but you cannot not do anything. And there are

tricks. As as I've just shared with you, that are all about good customer service that stop it

and then even when someones in the act of it approaching them with good customer

service as in let me help you with that. But at some stage it gets to the point. Well no you

did. And, well, let's why don't we just look in? Your back and if. If you're an honest person,

you're gonna be annoyed that you've been accused of something. But you're gonna open

your bag and then.

Cody

It was just fascinating. There were two team members in and this woman, and they were

approaching just like we taught them that she was tickling the products right behind her.

Speaker

Oh.

Cody

And literally had her back turned for one second while she was fixing something and they

were back-to-back. And this woman just loves it in her bag and just kind of moved around.

The nerve is unbelievable, but.

Brett

Yeah.

Cody

They didn't see anything. They they noticed about 30 minutes later that a couple of

products were missing and they were concerned that someone in the shop, which I'm so I

checked the footage and saw. But yeah, this is good. I'll, I'll write this up in the e-mail. I may

check with the honey Birdette team too to see if they have any language already written.

On.

Brett

They do do do exactly that, but I mean this is the the one of these things is don't be shy

about talking about this. It should be periodically discussed. If eventually when you run

managers meetings on a monthly basis and things you know with when you've got multiple

managers, you know this is the continuing thing that comes up on the umm. Writing this

stuff when you see this stuff real live. OK, now I'm gonna tell the whole team. Here's how

we handle this. Next time you're in their role play, what would you do? I'm stealing. What?

Would you do you know? Because yeah, people do. Freak out, but they don't need to freak.

Out.

Cody

Yeah, right.

Brett

It's not the first time it's gonna happen.

Cody

I know, Yep. Lots of lots of firsts for me. All right, well, let's we can run through these other

things really quickly. Mother's Day is coming up May 12th, I think.

Brett

Yeah, yeah.

Speaker

Yeah.
