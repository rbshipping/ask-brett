---

Yeah, right.

Brett

It's not the first time it's gonna happen.

Cody

I know, Yep. Lots of lots of firsts for me. All right, well, let's we can run through these other

things really quickly. Mother's Day is coming up May 12th, I think.

Brett

Yeah, yeah.

Speaker

Yeah.

Cody

We're a great store. I mean, we have a lot of. Gifts.

Brett

100% an experiment for sure.

Cody

Should I? That big sign that says keep mom calm.

Brett

And I I love it. Even keep mum. Calm. You know, it's just a great. It's just a great. Line, yeah.

Cody

And.

Brett

That in itself will suck people in big thing hanging in the window. Keep mom calm.

Cody

Yeah, yeah, all right.

Brett

You're a genius.

Cody

Yeah. OK, there a gun. Have you seen?

Brett

This thing I I saw it. I'm with you. It just it's moving us away. From what? What we are?

Cody

Struggling to find 500 four $100 products that fit our category, it's. Yeah, it's interesting. I

wanted more of those plants, but yeah, yeah. All right, keep looking. I'll avoid that one. It's

to the one thing I'll say is that's one of the most popular products on Instagram right now

just because it's got this funny video that people are watching. But yeah, I I think I think

that's not who we are.

Speaker

You know.

Brett

Yeah.

Cody

I agree.

Speaker

Refused.

Cody

Following up on Fashion Island, still haven't heard about them. I connected with our friend

who we met in the store. She was so flattered and excited to meet you. I think she did a

little research after she left. Wow. Love the timing. So that was fun. I'll talk to her. Dot UTC.

And South Coast Plaza is actually a better place for us to look. Instead of Brea mall.

Speaker

Yeah.

Cody

Yeah. Do you have any stores at South Coast Plaza? Yet.

Brett

No, we don't. It's too snotty for us.

Cody

OK, I don't know if that's a bad thing or a good thing for illness or not, but.

Brett

No, no, I think it's it sort of sits with it's more in line with Century City. Yeah, I I think yeah,

but. Then I'm. I'm. I'm cool. We'll do that. Yep.

Cody

All right. I want to just talk two more seconds about the in store signage on the nose

conversation. Glad.

Brett

Yeah.

Cody

So we can get really. In your face with it and put we Bates.

Speaker

Oh.

Cody

And anxiety management and self reflecting. And talk a little bit more in depth about each

of those things or we can be subtle. Did you have on on whether or not we should?

Speaker

That world.

Brett

I think again, we're experimenting. We're trying to find out how to connect and and. Shifting

it from the gift thing is. Feels right to me, so I. I've I've now got the answers led to what I

couldn't remember in the store. So it goes like this. Now this is all about CBD. Sorry

cannabis, smoke it, dab it, eat it, rub it, touch it, drink it as opposed to relax, sleep. And.

This is the same issue with what in the cannabis world that guys are calling the 3rd wave,

which is really getting it away from the ********. You know, I roll a joint and and I smoke it

into, you know, women and. And. I think this sort of goes was what I was trying to say is

that.

Speaker

OK.

Brett

So I'm with you on that. More. More in your face. It feels to me a bit in our face because

we're supposed to be sort of gentle and calming, but if you're OK with it, I feel that we got to

mix it up. And whether that transfer. So I think the idea of anxiety management, it might

sound a bit professional, but you might come up with another word, but it's, you know.

Speaker

Yes.

Brett

I got, you know, I got anxiety issues and we'll put the stuff here that you should consider to

to be using it and then underneath that, it might be, you know, you, you you eat it, you eat

this, you you rub it, you. Yeah, that applies far more for what's going on in the. Yeah, pure.

Cody

You actually like that quite a lot. The breakdown they had. I'm gonna play with that a little

bit. It's it's a little cheeky too, because it's referencing a Daft Punk song. I don't know if you

do that or. Not, but it's, yeah.

Brett

No, I didn't know. I mean, I'm 59. How would I know that?

Cody

It's there's a song I can send you a link to that it has that exact structure.

Brett

Yeah. Well, maybe we, maybe we should be playing that song. Is that a it's a no we.

Wouldn't be playing a?

Cody

Rap song. Surely it's definitely not OK for fun after this.

Brett

Do that, do that. Katy, I, I I, I. Believe I'm not sure 100% certain whether that like it's not one

of those moments where I go. No, we're. Doing the wrong thing. Do this, it's, but it's one of

those. Moments where I. Think we've gotta we're testing. We're trying to find and feel. What

what's right for the majority of the customers?

Cody

Yeah. Alright, cool. I'll I'll follow up on that one. Continue some thoughts. Last two quick

things, I just wanted to connect with other retail companies thanks to the wrong

connection. I'm going to talk to him, but just other people who have either started me

telling them, make their own or who start making their own just to see how they do it, how

they.

Speaker

Yeah.
