Brett

Start adjusting all those. Only got to that.

Speaker

Thanks. Thanks.

Brett

I've spoken with the the doctor.

Speaker

OK.

Brett

Yeah. Just did you put that in my medical?

Cody

File.

Brett

Excellent. It started already, so I can't say anything. Hey.

Cody

How you doing?

Brett

May I am perfect all the better for talking to you.

Cody

All right. How are you? I am good. I'm. Eager to figure this out.

Brett

Me too. Me too. I was writing. I do a quarterly sort of note to myself about what we're up to

and. Because I have nobody. To report to, except for myself, I report to myself. Sort of.

Because it's important to everybody, including me, to sort of fit, sit down occasionally.

Where are we at? Yeah, no, what are we? Doing. Had a had. We got. About.

Speaker

So.

Brett

And I we have checked with and we've gotta figure out how to commercialise that because

we're not there yet. And that was before you sent this in, yeah. But anyway, that's why we're

talking so regularly. Hopefully not sick of me and we gotta. So I'm 100% and in my head

there's a need. There's a connection and that's that's important. The question is, what are

we doing?

Speaker

Ah.

Brett

Or is it just simply that the need is not big enough to actually, you know, create a profitable

enterprise?

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

And I just don't think that's true. And there's no we're not getting the evidence and the data.

The data says that there isn't enough people at the moment. We need 20% more, at least in

that location. Yeah, but you're right. Any day sub pretty much any day. Sub 1000 is not good

enough for us.

Speaker

Yeah.

Cody

I hear. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

Brett

Anyway, there we go so. What do we do with the other ideas you wanna?

Cody

Yeah. So let me pull this up real quick.

Brett

I love the speed in which you got the science printed. Me, by the way. It's terrific. Yeah,

yeah.

Cody

Yeah, that was a new find. FedEx, actually, you can do it for 60 bucks. We got 2 signs

printed that day. Pretty.

Brett

Very impressive and made it's amazing just looking at those, you know, keep Mum calm.

You know whether they should be should have been bigger or you know all this stuff. We'll

learn. But it just adds something. Oh, it doesn't it? It just.

Speaker

Yep.

Cody

You had some reason to go. In. Yeah. I didn't get the malls approval which you usually have

to do, but screw them and then ask for forgiveness mode.

Brett

Correct screw. Hey, now you're talking like a real retail and. Then you screw. Them. Screw

them. You'll be saying that to. Yeah, alright, OK. So how can I?

Cody

Here's a look. Again, I don't know if we need to go over. Ad nauseam sales, but again, we're

not trending in the right direction. It's a problem we need to fix it. Uh. You know it's it's just

it's frustrating because Saturday we had a relatively average Saturday, Sunday. We were

doing great. 1400 is good for a Sunday for us. And then Monday we do 355 bucks. And it's

just, I'm telling you, it's not people like I've had different team on different days. I think my

best people were on yesterday. There's not enough people walk. It you know, and I didn't

think there was enough people, I was there all day yesterday. There were just not people in

the. Mall. So something to think about.

Brett

Yeah.

Cody

Part of my question is. You know, given that it's been two months now. And we're not

trending in the right direction. What does this mean? A for US and B, do we need to rather

than trying to tweak little things, do we need to start testing some more radical? Changes

because I'm not sure we can get to. To. 10K a week just by bringing in a handful of different

products. Yeah, yeah, you know, and and making these little tweets.

Brett

Johnny, the way you're approaching this is exactly right. So of course, sales are not our

problem. That's that's just the. The symptom of you know, So what I heard you say just then

was clarity on the team is not the problem and you're emphatic about that. So that's good.

So then it is our offering and our product. So I think the answer is yes and we we are in test

and trial mode, we can't look at going on doing 6 and $7000 a week. That just won't work.

And so whatever radical means. So I'm all in favour of radical, but that then. You know

what? What does that actually mean? We should go and do it without any conversation.

Whatever radical ID you've got, let's. Go on. Let's go and do it. And I say that and on the

basis that. Every indicator to me, I'm wired for a there's a demand. There's a need and

there's a want. There's an emotional connection, which is most. Important for a

successful. Retail offering. So it's it's there. We gotta go. Radical. So what's the radical?

What's the the top three radical ideas?

Cody

Good question. So. A couple of things we can get into some of the ideas down at the

bottom, but. Yeah. Why don't we we can just talk about those.

Speaker

Yeah, yeah.

Cody

So and I don't even think these are. Are what I would call radical, but there are definitely

other ideas. The the one that I was. Again, kind of interested in at least testing and I know

we briefly talked about it and you didn't really like the idea before was this? I hate. I hate

even calling it a vending machine.
