other ideas. The the one that I was. Again, kind of interested in at least testing and I know

we briefly talked about it and you didn't really like the idea before was this? I hate. I hate

even calling it a vending machine.

Brett

Yeah.

Cody

But it's you basically put our best selling products in a machine that we buy cheaply and

repurpose to make really beautiful and just putting them in stressed out places.

Speaker

Yeah.

Brett

Yeah.

Cody

And just seeing if people are, if it's really that people want the product or are they being

sold on the product because they're in the store? If we did that, I would say you'd actually

probably lean into the gift. Space a little bit more because you'd go put it in hospitals or

stressed out offices or big places where. You know, people want to buy a little something

for. Someone else? Yeah, the thing that's great about that idea is fixed costs for that

machine. There's zero labor costs. There's zero rent. If those things become in any way

profitable. They basically just print cash and you can put them in thousands of places all

around the world.

Brett

Yeah. Now, if you don't know this, but we own a 60% of a vending machine company.

Cody

OK.

Brett

Its own through the New York Private equity office. So know the business and.

Speaker

That's.

Brett

My interest in that business is the the technology changes that that are all happening.

Some of these guys. That there's sort of. An eclectic bunch of people that have their round,

they're usually retired and they're all getting old and they still take cash and they won't

upgrade it to. Taking credit cards and the thing that that we're pushing on is. The.

Essentially, unmanned mini markets that these have evolved too in safe, secure

environments like big offices, we works and you know that sort of stuff so.

Cody

I think that is such a big opportunity.

Brett

Yeah, now.

Speaker

So the.

Brett

So the the reason I'm telling you that is you don't have to explain to me. How all that works?

So I mean I'm 100%. With you, we'll bet you. I'm not sure that it's. The pot of gold that. We

would hope for in this environment. But the the answer is it's pretty easy to go to one of

those vendor people who make these things and adapt them to to put anything in I mean.

It's. That's that's easy. So you could probably get that done pretty quickly.

Cody

I would have thought, yeah. Good, because we're in test mode, it might be. Worth. Building

1 and putting it somewhere and seeing what happens.

Brett

Yeah. So let's just agree, because we gotta do something right now. Let's agree to that and.

Away you go.

Speaker

All right.

Brett

Do that. Got any other mad ideas?

Cody

Not mad ideas. I mean owning the shower conversation. I mean, yeah, yeah. I don't think

that's a good enough 1 yet. But I was saying you could turn the whole store into. Being

focused all around stress relief in the shower again, I don't think it's a. Good idea because

it's. We have to go back to what problem you're solving, and I feel like that's just a random

opportunity.

Brett

Yeah. It's sort of come out of. Well, that's a that's a it seems to me that that belongs in as if

we can get to bigger stores, which is the whole idea, then that would become a.

Cody

Section.

Brett

Subsection. Yeah, we're niching. We're we're niching 2 too small where we want to come

out wide and.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

Julie, would you come in here and find Stevens pictures that he sent from his visit in LA just

so and e-mail it to when you see it? There I'll e-mail it. Yes. Sorry. Go on.

Cody

I'm trying to dig deep on what's the problem we're solving. For for people, right, we want to

be creating value for people. And based on the store that we've had so far, it's I think the

problem we've been solving is usually. I want to get something for my stressed out friend.

Yeah. Or child, which is a. It's a big problem, but there are other parts of the puzzle like

we've talked about because this is anxiety. Just I'm not convinced that you can fix it with

consumer products, right? Like, it takes a lot of work and.

Brett

Admit I'm 100% convinced for those deep seated cases. Yeah. Would you just open up

those pictures?

Speaker

But. Men.

Brett

Yeah. Send that to. So I mean, I'm just having two conversations here.

Speaker

Send all that to Cody. Including the notes.

Brett

Just just right now, Senator, don't. So just forward that right now both those emails right

through to.

Speaker

Just follow it, yes.

Brett

And then leave them. I can. So. All that it's trying to tell whether she should be sending you

all that. Jody, Jody's our friend and partner. He's no secrets. She Julius through and she

protects me like no.

Cody

I miss Julia. How you doing?

Brett

There. Yes, I I agree that.

Cody

One of the biggest problems I keep hearing about is people have trouble finding therapists.

Yeah. Uh. I mentioned that before. I don't necessarily have a solution, but we could be

spinning our wheels trying to fix that and then retail element. I just don't know if.

Brett

Yeah. That fits well when I read your stuff. What resonated with me was, yes, I I agree that

we have always. Talked about we're we're a part of the solution. We're so in my mind the

the way that I really thought about this is when and now it's morphed into something
