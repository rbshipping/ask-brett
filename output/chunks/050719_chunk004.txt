take to get there. But I can play with that for. A little bit.

Brett

And play with it. I love that idea. And just if in your where you're playing with it and you find

people that are trying. To do this.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

How? How our little store at the moment could be a place where we could shift a bit. More

hard selling. And sign people be the place where, hey, this is this is potentially what you

need. Let me explain it to you and it cost X and we take a Commission for everyone. We

sign up or a trailing Commission or, you know, there are a whole host of because our job is

to help people introduce them to whatever. Solution that might be helpful to them. Yeah,

so that.

Cody

I think that's a really, really interesting business. So let me let me put some stuff together

and next time we talk, I'll, I'll walk you. Through some thoughts, yeah.

Speaker

Yeah.

Brett

Now in what I what I sent you, did you have you received those emails? Let me.

Cody

Let me look real quick, hang.

Brett

On so, these are two two things. So because we're invested in the. You know, pure

marijuana space out out of Denver. And Steven had some time before his flight, so there

were two things I wanted to show you. You know, they're, I mean, you're you're are fully for

me with Med men anyway.

Cody

This is the doses that just opened up.

Brett

Yeah, but look at that line the I asked the question about. Was there opening special? You

know what was going on? No, that's just that. That's pretty, pretty impressive. And then the

other one was just a bit more of. The.

Speaker

OK.

Brett

Where's they're going and going. Was a bit more on the the thing we were talking about.

You know, the kids love this song, by the way, technology technology.

Cody

Daft Punk.

Brett

Yeah. So there's one there that just sort of is along the, you know, look how that bliss

arrows, passion asleep. UM. Just an interesting way of it's not the packaging that, Stan, it's

you you want. Bless you want to be around, you want passion. You know, these are all

emotionally connecting.

Cody

Words. Yeah, yeah.

Brett

Different the different thing, but I just wanted to that, you know, maybe radical now, of

course this is a vertical business, all the boxing and branding you. Know it's it's. It's in many

ways too clinical, but that's what these guys are trying to do. Yeah. And they have the chill

out lounge. Which, if you look at the picture there. There's. It's a community like look at if

you open up that first one. That's a little section at the back of the store.

Speaker

OK.

Cody

I was here when they when they opened it was, uh, yeah. This is a big deal. I mean, this

store will probably barely make money because it's in a ridiculously good location on

Abbott Kinney. I can't even fathom what. Paying for the. Rent.

Speaker

Rule.

Cody

But I love it. This is this is kind of one of the more interesting approaches because there's

six skews in the whole store. And they're all 90. 8090 plus bucks. But you come into the

store and you feel calm immediately because they're. They're taking all of the choice out of

the equation for you, and it's the question you have to answer is how do you want to feel?

And then you're given 6 choices. Bliss aroused passion. Now they've been around for a

while and a lot of people. It's funny when you go to Med men and you ask them about this

brand, they actually don't recommend them at all. So it's it's kind of an interesting they

have.

Brett

They're they're competitors.

Cody

Well, well, that was before they had. That was way before any of this was a thing. They they

would always anyways. That's side.

Brett

Yeah, that's.

Cody

Yeah, I think this is an interesting strategy. You know, I know they've been working on this

permit for about two years. Of which I heard from Steve and you guys are experiencing with

the the company in in Colorado as well. You know it's it's a tough game, but once you got

the space. People like cannabis and they're going to they're going to. Keep coming back.

Brett

Yeah, yeah, that's that's correct. Now I'm not. It's just interesting that 27% of our sales are

coming out of CBD, yeah.

Speaker

Good.

Brett

And this this wasn't really a journey because of. Calmest. So I'm really pointing out that

merchandising because that's what I was trying to explain to you and then that.

Cody

Yeah, yeah.

Brett

Maybe that's something that we ought to it's just another confirmation that we should try

that. Then the community aspect of these. You know, you know, it doesn't surprise me

because you already spoke about the coffee concept I. Mean. You whack a coffee machine

there and you've got. A. You. You. You've got a business in that shot. You know where

they're all hanging out now. Of course, it's a beautiful Californian day and blah, blah blah,

but that was a random, you know, that's Stephen. Arrived and that's what was there. It

wasn't like he waited around four days to, you know, take the PR shot, you know, that's

right, he he was just there. Now I don't even know whether it's any good, and that's I I hate

these things because some some things that people spend a fortune on and fit out and and

they all look good, what matters is are there queues and are there people and are they

spending money and you know, and the answer looks like yes, but that's. Typically anyway
