these things because some some things that people spend a fortune on and fit out and and

they all look good, what matters is are there queues and are there people and are they

spending money and you know, and the answer looks like yes, but that's. Typically anyway

that. Just it's it's. More a a dump to you than of information, right? So.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

Let's. Let's do what you say. And. That'll do for today. Does that make that makes sense,

doesn't it? Try to figure that out.

Cody

Let me see what else. If there's anything else.

Brett

Yeah.

Cody

You know, still talking to the Fashion Island UTC guys. Again, I'm not.

Brett

If we're doing.

Cody

Six to seven KA week. I'm not that confident in going and opening up a bigger store of the

same thing.

Brett

No, either am I. It's it's, it's it's a reality check for us, but I'm repeating myself over and over

again. The problem is that that. The IT is a unique, yeah, location, you know, almost even in

America. You know the. Century city. I mean, it's not unique. There's twenty of those sorts

of things in. Yeah, in America. But it's a unique. Profile. It's a unique suburb. It is not, you

know, in in any way normal. And yeah, tourism just for one. But I also feel that it might be

worse. In a lesser. Allegation alright buddy. So. Will that do us for today that?

Cody

Real quick, last question. So we talked about this portal, the Peloton equivalent basically 2

quick notes on that. I I would love to do this design exploration where we hire an industrial

designer and they work with me and render actually what this could look like and talk about

what it would take to build it. It's going to cost us again another 10K just like the other

render that we got. I think. I think it would be. A worthy exploration, to be honest. The one

thing I'm worried about is with any big hardware company, the cost of manufacture, just

start going exponentially high, so we'd be. The millions of dollars.

Brett

It's crazy stuff. So, you know, I look at. It this way. We we've got an amount of money that

we've committed, I think more about you than I think about me. And so it, I'm almost if you

think that's a worthy. To to to blow your proportion and and it makes sense, but I feel that

that's that would just suck us. That would be the end of this, just to attempt to even. Yeah,

get that. Get that towing now. That's not to say that there might be other people that'll pile

the money in and and. And you know, that's worth. Thinking about as well. I mean raising

money at the moment. We're we're in the silly season of. You know, you just moneys just

piling in at ridiculous valuations and of everything. Now that doesn't necessarily make it

right, but that's it is an easy money environment at the moment, which either means

there's money for crazy, stupid ideas and. And for good ideas, there's multiple valuation.

You know that valuations are no one's ever going to make any money from it. But yeah,

that's OK when you're they. Sort of. OK, when you're the. When you're like us, we we just

take people's money. But that's not necessarily the right thing. Yeah, Senator, I I think. If

we're talking, something's gonna be millions and millions of dollars to actually get it going.

It's.

Speaker

Yeah.

Brett

It doesn't feel right.

Cody

All right. Well, my two things and work on the what the vending machine looks like and then

I'm working on the other model for our conversation on Thursday. Meanwhile, you know,

trying to tweak and add stuff to the store. But yeah, anything else.

Brett

That's all I've got for you.

Cody

All right, Brett.

Brett

Alright buddy. Thanks. Good luck. Keep at it. Talk to you soon. Bye bye.
