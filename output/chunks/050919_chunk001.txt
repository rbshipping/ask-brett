Brett

I.

Cody

Good morning.

Brett

Morning, brother.

Speaker 3

How you doing? Killing us today? Loving it.

Brett

1500 yesterday buddy yay.

Cody

Almost 1900, at the end of the day. Yeah. Strong winds there.

Brett

Strong day.

Cody

I think I think it's very clearly the seasonality gift thing. I mean I think. A lot of people came

in asking for Mother's Day gifts yesterday.

Brett

Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

Cody

Which, yeah, we'll take it the day we did 500 something so.

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Speaker

Let me see.

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Brett

I would wait and see on that because Mother's Day normally doesn't start until about

Friday. Yeah, it's, it's. A. I mean, typically it's a it's a build up from Monday. You know that

you can sometimes see a slight increase. And it kicks up because most people don't think

about their oh, God, it's Mother's Day, and then they dash out. And that's when most

people. So we were just just wait and see. Yeah, yeah. I think we will take it. That's the

point, right? We will take it.

Cody

Big day. We will take it. We will always take it.

Brett

Yeah, alright. What's new, mate? Because I feel like we've gone to twice a week. And so

just what's on your mind? What can I?

Cody

Yeah, the the couple of things, a couple other updates where we had a pretty big Instagram

influencer come in one video and post. And we now have we had 200 followers, now 500,

it's kind of arbitrary, but. It does work. That's that's how you grow things. So we might

explore doing more of that.

Brett

Stuff. Yeah. I mean, there's no doubt the influences of the new new way, yeah. Yeah.

Cody

Beautycon. They love us, they just love the brand, they love everything. We stand for. The

founder deeply resonates. They're one of the most influential groups of it's an event that

happens in New York and LA. I think we mentioned it last time, but it's it's all it's thousands

of these influencers in one place, mostly focused on beauty, but they're trying to get into

health and. Wellness. Effectively want us to put our store in their convention for two days.

Normally they would charge companies to do that, but they will. They're giving it to us for

free because they love. We love what we do. We just have to decide if we want to actually

invest in doubling the inventory and shelving or whatever for the space for two or three

days.

Brett

What I mean? Well, the pro the it's a simple pros and cons. Instinctively, that would just be

a Horror Story for no value. But maybe are you thinking anything differently?

Cody

Well, I think if we did anything, it would be maybe taking our top 10 or 20 products and

doing just a little. A little display rather than reproducing the whole store.

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Cody

You can do a little featurette if you will, yeah. It's it's in August. It's not that big of a deal, but

it was interesting again. It's just tricky because we have all these people who really the

founder deals with anxiety and she just loves the brand she loves what we're all about. She

loves that it's accessible. So again, those are great validators. They want to do things with

us. We just have to figure out where to take this and how to cater to that. Is clearly

resonating.

Brett

We clearly. So I think more and more you and you and I are agreeing that there's

something. There's a connection here. We've got something. We're just. We gotta make it.

A A real business. And these are just validations, right? I always worry a bit about people

who are validating us. Who have who have got? A reason to validate us like. The guys that.

Run these conferences and and all these things you know, they all as they do all day is tell

we love you we. Love what you do and and. You've got to you got to read through all that

and then they go, yeah, yeah. We'll give you this for nothing half the time. That's their plan.

Give the first. Give it to them. 1st for nothing. If it works, I'll come. Back next year. Because

we're making our money from selling tickets to.

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Brett

So you've gotta be careful with what's their intent behind those those words. But maybe

you could you're you could not figure that out smart enough.

Cody

Bashan Island rang me back yesterday and wanted to know all of our sales numbers and I I

didn't tell them, but yeah, they're they're trying to put together a proposal for those spaces

and something else, so I'll keep. You updated on that.

Brett

Yep.

Cody

And then we did the Tea drops demo this weekend, where we had a big booth outside

serving tea. We sold twice as much tea, which is good, but I didn't see any big update or big

bump in sales because of it. I. Think it was just a. Yeah, not not something that I think was

that successful as a marketing tool to get people in the store. But it was a good test.

Brett

It's great stuff this energy. So we sold more tea. How much did it cost us to do that?

Cody

Anything no 0.

Brett

Then we did. This is the stuff that's all worthwhile. You don't always have to see. It's always

much better if you see something that just is obvious. But all these things. That, you know,

builders of culture and confidence and awareness of the team like it, you know, blah blah

particularly they don't cost us anything.
