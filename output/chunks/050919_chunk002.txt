much better if you see something that just is obvious. But all these things. That, you know,

builders of culture and confidence and awareness of the team like it, you know, blah blah

particularly they don't cost us anything.

Cody

Perfect. Yet let's uh let's chat. I see this deck. There's a bit of a deep dive on these two

spaces. Therapy. Concierge. Did you look at these statistics? Pretty wild.

Brett

Wild, but in many ways not surprising. I mean, that's what.

Speaker 3

We're all about, right? Yeah.

Cody

Uh. The the couple of takeaways here are the. We're not the first one to have this idea.

There are a lot. Of. Very qualified, well funded people working on it from a number of

different angles. So if we want to get into this space, we either need to have a unique edge

or something a little bit different because it's clearly being done. One medical the billion

dollar company that I mentioned is now. They sent me this e-mail talking about they're

offering mental health services. That was yesterday, which is completely random and

timely. A couple of their execs have left and are now launching just a mental health studio.

Called octave. Again, there's another one called 2 chairs. These are all.

Brett

Just give me your extra data point.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

Dave is what does it actually do when you say mental health studio, it has practitioners

and. Therapists or yoga and stained baths.

Cody

Well, no, no, it's it's, it's therapy, it's cognitive behavioral therapy.

Brett

OK, so it's the real.

Cody

It's the real yeah. Yeah. Let me find what their website is.

Speaker 3

Oh.

Cody

Evidence based therapy and Wellness Center. So I think they do individual and group

therapy.

Speaker 3

Oh.

Cody

Modern studio built for the needs of busy working class professionals. Finding the right

therapist or coach can be hard. Clinicians, experts in their fields. Yeah. Therapy, coaching

and classes in person sessions one-on-one program. It's interesting. They're all doing

coaching now like we talked about, which is. Different than licensed therapist. And then

classes cover a range of topics from sleep to mindfulness techniques and everything in

between. Now the issue is these are very localized, so I think this one's only in San

Francisco now.

Speaker 3

Oh.

Cody

It hasn't gotten out of San Francisco, either. Because they're new or because it's expensive

or this is actually in New York City? Yeah. You know, these things just might be really hard

to scale because there's different. Regulations in each state.

Brett

Yeah, 100% of these things are hard to do. My immediate response was how do we? As an

adjunct to what we are doing. So there's two ways to think about it. How do we add how?

How has some of this become a product that we can sell market in, in our, in our, in our

locations? Or is this something where? I don't know. There's two parts. Where can we ring

all these guys? Not the New York one. That's not going to work. But you know, Amanda, you

know, she's the. She's a coach, right? Yeah. Can we take, you know, we sell and introduce

but for two parts. So, hey, Amanda, we're gonna introduce you to these customers, and

we're gonna sign up. We're gonna make the bookings for you. Something like that. Because

when people coming in, well, we then we advertise their their service, we market their

service. The sign. And now we introduce and we get something for that now. I don't like that

because these it's hard to get reoccurring revenue and and and things of that nature, but

it's a it's as much credibility for us that Yep, we've got people this is you know with and and

we'll help we'll do it for you. We'll do it for you right now in the store. You know whether like

the sales. Uh. Is that possible? I shouldn't? Yes, it's a. It's a sales technique which most of

these organizations aren't. Crypto good at that then adds credibility back to vice versa.

Amanda has a relationship with us now. That seems hard to scale also, but not not, not,

not necessarily a problem. Then the other thing was we've got that out the back space.

Why don't we set it up and and run class? It's. Hey, Amanda, come and we'll organise it.

We'll we'll have group therapies on and you know it's 20 bucks. Ago and and now it's. We

could maybe make it half conducive to. I think maybe I haven't thought any of that through.

That's your job, but. That that's the sort. Of couple of things that from the thing you sent me

yesterday and the notes today. And does that lead us to something where we have got a

store at the front? Yet we're running and it would take us out of shopping centres, but it

would put us into where, you know, we've got 5 or 6 therapists and mental coaches and we

run classes and that leads to individual because it it is quite amazing the amount of people

when they sit with the right person. And. Just have someone give them a bit of. Support and

clarity.

Cody

Yeah, you know, the 11 hole in the market, I didn't know if this is a good idea or not. I'll just

throw up by you, so. Instead of therapy where? The patient goes in and they're reflecting on

themselves and talking about their problems. Sometimes people just need motivation.

They need their mood enhanced, they need to be excited about life and all of these things

that are happening and I.

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Cody

I haven't seen anywhere doing just a motivation class or a. Get jazz class where it's not
