what whatever you think made 20 bucks a session. Or 30 or. Yeah. Is that, does that lead

us into something? How popular would that be?

Cody

Yeah, let's test it. Let's see. I'm going to design a couple. I'll talk to Amanda. I'll talk to a

couple other people and see if I can. We could test 3 or 4 different class concepts and just

see what happens. See what they see, what they go for, or how popular they are.

Brett

Yeah. It exactly. And what's that going to cost?

Speaker 3

I mean.

Brett

It's, you know. 500 bucks for a man or for, you know, 6 different classes or whoever else.

And just say.

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Brett

Yeah, that that sounds sounds good. I also like the idea of all these places that are signing

up. Can we help you? You know, if we send you a customer, will you? Send us 100. Bucks

referrals referrals. Now I don't. I don't think that's a long term. UM. That doesn't feel like it's

anything but. It would give his daughter. It would give us. You try it, we test it. How admit if

we if we were wrong and signed up 7 people one week and we got a. 100 bucks every time

we did it well.

Speaker 3

How are you?

Cody

Keep digging there and I'll see if I can reach out to those people. I don't think any of these

are based in LA other than. One medical but. They would never do a referral thing. Their

their model is it's a $200 annual membership and then. Basically, the gem model there is

assuming most people won't come in.

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Cody

Which is interesting too.

Brett

But is that so? We'll we'll take 33 bucks every time we sign up a $200.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

One thing our guys, we don't, we don't have enough to do for our team. So it's not, there's

not huge cost on that. You know, it's just trying another product. I mean it's just the just

the, the product we're selling that provided it's credible.

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Brett

Because that'll be relying on 200 bucks.

Cody

Multiple times. Yeah. Yeah. I'll ask. Why not? Can't hurt, right?

Brett

And even if you offer to it sometimes. Hey, we'll do it for free. You know, just give us the

marketing material and we'll see what happens and if we send you 20. People you'll pass.

OK, we send you 20 now we gotta charge you that. They'll charge us, right?

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Cody

All right. The last thing was the vending machine model, which I think is I actually think is

really interesting. One of these things for four to 5K, a fresh new one. It's not any one of the

very technologically advanced ones, but it would work. You can fit 60 to 70 skews. We

picked 65 skews that we like and assuming 5 or 6 of them, we get to 6 or 7 grand worth of

product in each. Living machine. I have no idea if people would buy this stuff from a

vending machine. I really don't know. But again, it might be. It might be worth the test that

we're going to spend 10K on someone to sketch out a pod. We. Could spend something

like that to put these in a really interesting place and see what see what happens. But if

that works and people are buying this stuff, I mean those these will print cash, you can put

them in thousands of places. So I don't know, it seems pretty interesting. To me.

Brett

It all as I know it says. The only thing I know is that. There's tons of money being made out

of these things, but it's all about drinks and chips and you know, and you know, these

things are in hospitals and. You know where. I just need a crunchy bar or and.

Speaker 3

Uh.

Brett

So yes, that they they work. They exist. People know about them, they use them. Yeah. It's

just whether they're going to buy. Yeah, I don't know. Put CBD in there now. You don't worry

about security too much because they always go into places that are, you know, 24 hours

and, you know, videos all around. I mean, you don't put them anywhere that. Doesn't

doesn't have that sort of security.

Cody

Do you know your other business? Do you have to pay to put them places or?

Brett

Yes. Yeah, there's no question that, you know, in many cases it starts off as a service, like

hospitals have crash example. They've got no freaking clue how to run anything but a

hospital. They they're, they're brainless. It's not their focus. Uh. And you know, it's a

distraction to them. But what they do realize is people get cranky because they can't get a,

you know, they're in the they can't get a drink. So they that's an easy solution or put a coke

machine in the corner and. And then the smarter ones eventually figure out that these guys

are making money. And so we go to them. We gotta take that out. Now. Sometimes it

doesn't happen and sometimes it does. And then there are others. Landlords that know the

value of these things, like shopping centers and. There is a going rate that. Is just just the

same, so there's no vending machine in any of the shopping malls. You're you're talking

about. That do not pay a rent. And and some of them pay big rents. I mean, I'll give you an

example that the ATM machines pay an extraordinary rent. In our property departments

and we have you know, 20 ATM machines and they'll pay ten, $15,000 a year for this little

space that nothing. And they they pay us because. That's that's the value, the convenience.
