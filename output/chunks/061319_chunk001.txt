Speaker

Morning buddy.

Cody

Hey.

Brett

So it's a great week.

Cody

It's a great week. You, are you happy? I am happy. I am. I am perplexed and excited and

don't know if it's too early to tell.

Speaker

Yeah.

Brett

What was yesterday?

Cody

We did 12111 hundred again.

Brett

1100 I've got it here. Yeah. Gee, you must have did this late. Let's understand this.

Speaker

Yeah.

Cody

Last night.

Brett

Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK. Yes, 1100. So when did we did meet? Saturday and Sunday? Did we

make the shift or or that's just the start of the week when when did you actually?

Cody

Yeah. So Saturday, we started Sunday, we put the decals up. Saturday we started moving

the stuff in the store and put signage in the store. Sunday we put the decals up and then

really. Took inventory away and made the sales section put everything in each part of the

store and then changed the whole sales pitch to the staff. Or the team to talk about

anxiety, pain and.

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Brett

So if we were really being wanting to make ourselves feel better, we would, we could

possibly, we certainly could ignore Saturday and maybe Sunday, and then you're looking at

65339, right? Yeah. Yeah. OK. Because we sort of. Need that 2530%.

Cody

Kicker. Yep, exactly.

Brett

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. Well, it's amazing. Isn't this retail thing amazing?

Cody

I I if if this was it, if this makes the. That little bump happened. I will be. I will forever bow to

your genius.

Brett

What? What do you mean you're not? You're not already?

Speaker

Hi. I.

Cody

I am but this this is a call I would have never in a million years made. I really. I really. They

just. I wouldn't have. I wouldn't have guessed at all. Again, I think it's too early to say, but I

am. It feels good, it feels like. The conversations we're having in the store, what my team is

saying, people are coming in and walking to the section that they need help with. It has felt

much less gifty because people are going straight to those issues. And again, I feel like

we're. We haven't even fully transitioned the store. I mean it is, it's still similar to what it

was a week ago because we have a lot of inventory that's doesn't perfectly fit, but.

Brett

Yeah.

Cody

Yeah, you know, and the other thing is it's it's Father's Day on Sunday, so that could be a

factor. But again, people haven't really been talking about it and. Like you said, I don't think

they start buying for that until Friday, Saturday.

Brett

Promise you Monday sales Tuesday sales had nothing to do. With Father's Day. Maybe

Saturday sales, we'll have something to. Do with Father's Day.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

But what what I I agree with you that you know we we wait and.

Speaker

That's great.

Brett

See, it's it's. Too early, but really encouraging signs. What's most important here to focus

on is is the learning. Because, I mean, there isn't a lot of genius in this. There is just

recognising that the way you present and what you do makes a difference in retail as much

as as anything and and. It's even looking at the energy that you know some. Of those, just.

The new excitement that's happening in the store and it's the team that. Come alive. It's a

you know, a combination of things, which is hopefully not. Why it's, you know, 65339. You

know, that's a. Big fall off. And the call to actions, all those things like you've now

resignated, you know, pain and sleep. So it's there and there'll be other things as well. So

the the important point is here we did this and we certainly have seen a bump. You know

what else is there that would give us a bump before we write the concept off? As you know,

just not, not not enough interest.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

But maybe we've learned something. You speak to them directly and it resonates, right?

You know pain.

Speaker

Just.

Cody

Yeah, yeah.

Brett

Yeah. Yeah. All right. So went down to your. Agenda.

Cody

All right. So we just talked about sales there. We can talk a little bit about what we've done,

but we we mostly discussed that. We have slowly been taking the skews down. We have a

section in the store that's, you know the sale section 50% off, limited success there. It's

just not some of the stuff I I guess people just don't really want. So and it just kind of looks.

Gross to have a pile of all the stuff that's on sale. I can keep it there and see what people

do, but. Yeah.

Brett

It it always, it always looks gross. And and we do have to. We we will always have to deal

with stuff that we that we bought too much of or that. Nobody wants so part of me says just

take it out for the moment. The other part says. Sale is a part of every every anybody that

sells anything, they have to clear the. Stuff that they get wrong. Uh. Now, how much did?

What was the sales like with 10% of the store or three percent, 1% what what came out of

that markdown product?

Cody

That's a good question. I have to go. I have to go look into that. I can get.

Brett

Back to you on that, because sometimes you think it looks like ****, but you find, oh, ship

we sell. 25%. Of our stuff out there. And you know, because you'll always. Get a bump at

when you go on sale. Believe it or not. You just don't get a profit bump. You get a sales
