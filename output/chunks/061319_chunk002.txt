we sell. 25%. Of our stuff out there. And you know, because you'll always. Get a bump at

when you go on sale. Believe it or not. You just don't get a profit bump. You get a sales

bump because people love a sale. They can't help themselves. They love a bargain. All

right, so, man, I I think it's your call. You're on the on the ground. And I I think. If we're we're

trying to figure out the concept and you think it's getting in the way, then just, you know,

stick it in your bedroom for. Until we figure it out.

Speaker 3

OK.

Cody

All right. I will make the call. Probably leave it out for a couple more days, maybe to the

weekend and then next week be a little bit more aggressive about it. Yeah, yeah. Still trying

to make the store feel less cluttered. It's better than it was, but still a long way to go. You

know. We had those beautiful. Decompress, discover and delight signs made. And the guy

quoted me something like 6 or 700 bucks to get him made again for pain anxiety sleep. So I

just went to FedEx and got these little PVC. Things printed for 20 bucks or something.

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Cody

They don't look perfect, but like we said, they don't have to be perfect. If, if long term we're

going in that direction, maybe we should make them a little bit better. But for now, there's

just. It's basically a poster Velcro onto that wooden thing. Any thoughts there or just keep

it?

Brett

But I think you're on the right track here, and it's there's there's a heap of learnings and you

got to think if we do that. That cause cause you're already surprised that what we've done

could have, you know, lifted our sails by 40%. You gotta. Figure out which. Parts drove that.

Right. And and then so that if if you think it's all right at? The. Moment. Leave it be. If you

think doing it right, it's going to add another. Keep the same thing you know. Do it.

Speaker 3

All right.

Speaker

1st.

Brett

Because you're still figuring out how the hell does one change it? Assign, you know, do

something, you know, like.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

Calls from customers in yeah.

Cody

Turn around the bottom shelves and the exterior. I still need to figure out what to do about

the wood because it's getting kicked. A lot, especially by the meditation chair that we have,

it's really looking bad because people are getting up on the chair and kicking that whole

area and knee. So I just didn't mind.

Brett

Yeah. In in many ways, that's just a floor of our design and so figure out what you're gonna

do. And of course, you know, as we go on, we. Wouldn't we'll do it differently? You know,

it's a hard question.

Cody

Yes.

Brett

I'm kicking myself for not. Telling you about that because you know these are easy lessons.

Next item, Dan, people have feet, you know, and their feet stick out further than anything

else. It's really.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

Who would have thought, right?

Cody

You thought?

Speaker

Yeah.

Cody

So I sent a picture of the front of the store. So what happened was we got those decals that

I sent you made, but this interior applied sticky thing. When I pulled the white off, you

basically could not see the red or the blue. They became completely.

Speaker 3

Look.

Cody

Transparent in the window. So I put those white things up and it actually looks. It's quite

good. It's still subtle, so I got them, they comped us and I got them remade bigger and

white. But again, sales have been up. So I'm wondering if I should change them or add the

bigger thing. Or leave them for a week and see what happens. Add these other big ones

that I got made to other windows around the store. I just wanted to get your sense what you

thought of that picture.

Brett

And when I looked at the picture, I thought my instant thought without having all that

explanation was not not not aggressive enough. Yeah, so. On the basis that we've been sort

of right so far, go, go. The bigger because that feels to me that, you know, experience says

that that's that's the tipping point here. We're speaking directly to them, which is what I,

you know, was hoping that we would have would achieve.

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Brett

If we get it wrong, wait again. We're we're trying to sort this out. So we're not trying to save

that. The dollars here on this, we're trying to figure it out. So you know, I feel go bigger. And

you'll get a. You'll get a sense of it.

Speaker 3

All right.

Cody

I'm picking those up today, so I'll send you a picture once we get up.

Brett

Right.

Cody

Let's see the Middle Island. We haven't really touched. We'll need to figure out what to. Do I

think?

Speaker

Now let's look at.

Brett

A little lonely in the window, just as a.

Cody

Yeah, yeah, yeah, we, we.

Brett

They they look a little like, you know, that's. An afterthought, but.

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Cody

Yeah, we got those. Originally when we had those displays up front cover the cover, the

wires, I can move them.

Speaker

Yeah.

Cody

Let's see. Yeah, the the next thing to do is like we talked about kind of the pamphlets and

educational material and in store signage that's going to be a big undertaking. So I need.

To. Just figure out how to chunk that down and and get it done.

Brett

Yeah, that in many ways now that I've. I think we can both say we've got a bit more
