educational material and in store signage that's going to be a big undertaking. So I need.

To. Just figure out how to chunk that down and and get it done.

Brett

Yeah, that in many ways now that I've. I think we can both say we've got a bit more

confidence now in this new direction, right? Yep. I feel that. That's the once they're in the

store, that's the bit that's missing mostly. So I'm quietly confident that that's going to be.

Another kicker for us, so try to get it going as fast as you can, but but keep it simple. Keep it

educational. This is just this is. Our. This is our credibility we're handing over to you. Here's.

Is the answers and we're selling at the same time, yeah, I think.

Cody

Is that in your mind? Just kind of. Relatively big signs have a couple of facts about sleep

and sleep disorders and what to do about it.

Brett

Yeah, I think it's. I think it's a sign that pulls us in and then then there's a, you know, the the

expensive parts going to be. The the sort of. Pamphlet now when you're figuring it out and if

you can figure out whether you can get sort of that pamphlet on one page. But if you try to.

Cody

Put a a.

Brett

Call to action sign that has everything in it. It's you know, you're trying to make a pamphlet

that people can read. It it doesn't. We, you know you can't. You can't. You genuinely can't

get the whole answer into one thing. You've gotta pull people in. Bang, bang, bang. Then

there's a pamphlet to read more. And this is what you need, you know. You know, here's

your selection of 20 things or that might. Be might help. I think we got to play around with it,

man. I'm almost feel like get started. It might take 3 iterations to get this get this right.

Cody

OK, I'll make that a priority, though. The nice thing is we have a lot of our, the, the book that

sells really well are these books that say how to sleep, how to become, how to. So there's

literally a. Abundance of material that we can just. Go. Steel and pull from to.

Speaker 3

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Cody

So that's that's a priority. I wanted to I didn't fully understand your text on the T-shirt, so I've

I've held off ordering. Did you feel like we needed to go a little bit harder hitting?

Brett

Not now. I felt so. I got a bit nervous. Maybe it's you that's made me nervous because

America, the nuances around. Umm. You know retail therapist, meaning that we're sort of

subtly saying that we're. That we are qualified, that was my. My sort of all. Are we going into

a place that's dangerous? Because it says. What does it say? Retail therapist.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

Now I get that we're not telling. You we're the. We're just retail therapists, as in, you know,

hey, we're we're, we're here to help. So it was you that made me nervous because it says

therapist right now.

Cody

Yeah. Because you've heard the the term retail therapy, right?

Brett

Retail therapy, but that's yeah. Different as in retail therapy means I've got to go shopping,

right? Yeah. I got to get my fix. I've got to.

Cody

Yeah, exactly, that. That's what it's playing off of. But I can see how I can see how you're.

Speaker

Yeah.

Cody

Interpreting it as you're a therapist. In retail.

Brett

Yeah. Now I'm not worried about it, but then given.

Cody

So.

Brett

What something's happening in the store, we'll we'll know for sure if, with a few more days

sales but. I think that we're just we're speaking more, more retail therapists like we're

softening it. We think we gotta keep pushing, you know that just that pain, as you said, they

gravitate towards that pain sleep, it resonates with me. So wherever we can put it. So I'm

still probably feeling the right answer is just to keep the same theme going.

Cody

Yeah.

Speaker 3

Alright.

Cody

I think as you predicted again, the team does not like the idea of wearing shirts that say

pain and sleep and anxiety on them. They were the only reason I was excited is they got

excited about retail therapists and I thought it was kind of a quirky thing to do.

Brett

Wait, listen. Go to. Again. You're on the ground and you're dealing with this. I I don't. Don't.

Pander to, I mean, we're trying to figure out here and so don't hand it to the fact that they

don't want to wear something that says. Pain. I mean it's it's just it's not, it's not them, it's

it's that's the uniform and requiring them to wear a T-shirt that doesn't say anything a a

fancy if it's just the same thing that's. On the window, that's. Yeah, just tell them. Hey,

guys, get over it where we're doing. We're reaching out to people who are in pain. You

know, but. You're you're more millennial and all that need to in the sense of trying to

understand why. But what you don't want to have is this mutiny of people that are are

dictating to to you what the hell we're promoting and how we're promoting it. How we're

speaking to our customer, that's that's our job, not 17 year old. Yeah, yeah. So is it just that

they don't want it or they feel that there is some disconnect?

Cody

Yeah, I think I've been hesitating. On the retail therapist piece for exactly the reasons. You

feel nervous about it, but I've also been hesitating on the pain sleep anxiety thing. For a
