they don't want it or they feel that there is some disconnect?

Cody

Yeah, I think I've been hesitating. On the retail therapist piece for exactly the reasons. You

feel nervous about it, but I've also been hesitating on the pain sleep anxiety thing. For a

number of reasons. So maybe we're not. We haven't found exactly yet. I mean, I don't know

if it's it would be useless just to have shirts that say call. Missed on it.

Brett

That I think that's going back to where we. So I think what we've seen is there's something

in what we. What sort of let's? Call it. Phase two or version 2, there's something in this we

can for sure say there's something here. Now. We don't want to go back. We want to go

forward. And we are pushing it. We gotta push harder. We can always come back but

going. Soft. It's so hard. So the calmness is just you know we we had that we got it on the

front of. The door, you. Know there's nothing. There's nothing. So I mean, you've got, I think

you've got to find those strong words. I mean, so I suppose they're not going to. Be really

happy with suicide. That was a joke.

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Brett

But we remember I'm, you know, remember, I'm all about culture and team and fun and.

But but that you, you. You don't want to be asking the team what they want to do or what

they're happy with. You know this is do what we gotta do. And here's the job and. We're

trying. We're fighting for our lives here and we we don't. They gotta be a part of the solution,

not a part.

Speaker 3

Of the problem, yeah.

Brett

And hey, we're figuring it out. You you don't want to say things like that. Hey, we're figuring

it out. Let's do it for a month and see what happens. Yeah, you know, unless you think that.

Just people hate change. Anyway, that's maybe there are some halfway words or

something different, but I don't think we should be doing halfway measures at this

moment. Yeah, yeah. Now, and of course, one of the ways to get around is you've got to get

a T-shirt on and you've got to wear it. And you know, then you know just.

Speaker 3

Yeah, that's the way it goes.

Cody

Just I know we're spending a lot of time on this, but if if the shirt just said pain, sleep and

anxiety rather than one of each of those words, you think that's fine or. That's.

Speaker 3

Yeah, I.

Brett

I do, but I'd I'd really like that I, you know, the the you can tell my thing here bigger because

we're we're resigning speaking we're you know we've got a mega fund to this that's and

that's why they feel uncomfortable because we gotta mega fund and.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

But that's what we. Particularly, even more so in, you know, I shouldn't say in America

because you only know America, but you do have to, you have to be over the top on

everything. It's got to be more powerful, more energy, bigger, louder. You know, that's that.

That resonates now. You, you guys don't think anything differently because you. Haven't

got a. You know, like we operate in many countries, but so I think. Push it through. If you

had to go down to three, just just do it. But I think let's. Just get it. Because the most

powerful signage you have is the team because it's moving. It's it's. It's why it's it's worth

the expense of it, because it's just not static. It's. Yeah, it's actually in your face. It moves

backwards and forwards. And. And. They're ambassadors.

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Cody

All right.

Speaker 3

Or.

Cody

Let's see. Yeah. So the other thing is just we need to kind of fill out the sections a bit with

more sleep products, more products focused on pain, more products. We have a lot of

anxiety. We just need to tailor that one down.

Brett

Yeah.

Cody

Pain I still feel is a little bit vague. But it's definitely requested what we're ultimately selling

the most of is CBD, and that's what's in the paint section. So that might be worth thinking

through a little bit to kind of take that down a level because you got a pain. You got any CVS

or? Chemist there's a whole section of Advil and Tylenol and all these things for pain, right?

Brett

Yeah, but we're suddenly talking about mental anguish and mental pain, and yeah, that

resonates itself sometimes into physical pain. Yeah.

Speaker 3

And you know.

Brett

We're not here to because you, you, you and I both know that. The painkillers get rid of the.

Pain doesn't help with the cure. Now there's a subtle difference between what we do,

right? We. We're we're never going. The cell. Tylenol, right. Because that's not the answer

to the to the problem. And it depends on. Anyway, here I'm having. Why am I even you? You

get it, so I think. That's where we're suddenly going. Pain. You know what? What? Where

does this pain come from? Is it originate? If it's if. It's like my bloody shoulder like that, that.

Had to have an MRI on yesterday. You know, that's got nothing to do with anything. That

calmness is about. It's just leaving and joints are bloody wearing out. And I've got a door

there and.

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Brett

Ain't no nothing in Common's gonna help me. Just.

Cody

Maybe some of the CBD cream, might you ever know?

Brett

Well, it will cover the pain, right? But it's not. It's not the issue, but. So somebody comes in
