there and.

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Brett

Ain't no nothing in Common's gonna help me. Just.

Cody

Maybe some of the CBD cream, might you ever know?

Brett

Well, it will cover the pain, right? But it's not. It's not the issue, but. So somebody comes in

and we're not there to tell them, hey, you need to go see a physiotherapist. And if that's not,

that's that's a therapist of a different kind.

Cody

Yes. Fair enough.

Brett

So that's where we've gotta go. We've got gotta go into that. I'm sure we can't compete

against Kemps pharmacies. Yeah.

Speaker 3

We are great. That's that. Right. Alrighty. So.

Brett

You don't need me anymore.

Cody

So couple I have a couple of questions and things to chat about that I want some help with.

So. We have about is my video frozen, by the way.

Brett

Yeah, my mind is I can hear. You perfectly, but nothing's. Ah. Is mine frozen as? Well.

Cody

No, no, yours is working perfect.

Brett

Yeah, yeah. I don't know why you you're. I just got your smiling face. It's a good shot.

Cody

Oh man, so we have about 600.

Brett

Followers know. How do you know that the screen? How did you know? That how did you?

Cody

Know that ask that question because the little thumbnail of me. On frozen.

Brett

It's not moving. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Cody

So we have actually almost 700 followers now on Instagram and I posted a little poll

saying, hey, how do you feel about a subscription box, yes or no and pretty much everyone

said yes.

Brett

Yeah. Now I tried to look at these pictures to see which one we are friend but.

Cody

Surprisingly, not many, which is interesting, but yeah, it is still it's I. I get that it's 20 people,

23 people or something. Yeah, it's very small sample size, but. It is an interesting solution.

Brett

We're not. Cody, when I saw it, I loved it. I went well. Where? Where? We've been on this so

23 people said yes. So even if we. Even if we, you know, took the the stats of that and it

ended up being 3 on a monthly subscription. Yeah. Everything is incremental improvement

once we get to. And what are you? What were you thinking? Because you know, when I say

they'll say yes. But then you say it's going to be 50 bucks every month and you know you'll

get a drop off rate, right? But you end up with 50 bucks for three or four people. That's 200

bucks. That's a little tiny. Half a percent increase over the. Yeah, that's. That's how it works,

so. Shipment I I think that's a pretty good start.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

And did you send them the box with that that that like, did you, did you send them this or

that?

Cody

No, no, that's just.

Speaker

Yeah.

Cody

Yesterday I had the team I bought a couple of boxes. I had the team go around putting

together a little combinations to see what we could do. The one you're holding is a $99 box.

The $45.00 it just. We don't. Our products aren't cheap enough like they just you can't fill

them with enough things to. Make it competitive.

Brett

Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Cody

The frustrating part is you've got Fab Fit fund, which is a billion dollar company. They have

this huge box and it's $200 worth of material allegedly and it's 45 bucks. On the customer.

So they must have some kind of crazy partnership with all of these people that are using it

as marketing.

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Cody

I don't know how the hell they make. That work because.

Brett

Or sometimes they. These they're doing this crazy loss leading stuff to build, you know,

customer acquisition, who knows. So. So I mean is that there's that what you're saying the

next step is here it is this will be your first month and it's 99 bucks to the to those 23 people

or all 700 and see what happens.

Cody

Oh yeah, we have, yeah, an e-mail list of about 6 or 700. 700 year and then the the beautiful

thing about this is that a $99 price point you can really run a Facebook ad against it and see

people converting and if it costs us. $10 to acquire a customer, then we should be pouring

money on it, yeah. Because there's a margin there and yeah, it's it's easy. It's easy to scale,

in theory. The tricky part is operationally, this is a bit challenging because. You have to

pack a lot of boxes, ship a lot of boxes, move a lot of products. We have no idea how much.

So. So what I'm going to do as a next step is basically. Redo the website to focus on these

boxes and then launch a presale. And and see if people will pre buy them saying shipping in

two weeks limited supply 100 available 20% discount and get them now and see if people

like them.

Brett

You know I love, but I mean the what I love most about it is that you've got 23 positive

responses, you know converting 10% of those and then you know doing that, that's that.

And there's a a new way to figure it out.

Cody

Yeah. All right. Well, I'll play with that experiment and let you know what happens if, if that.

Brett

It's a brilliant idea.

Cody

If it ends up working. Not we're going to. Yeah. I don't want to get ahead of myself, but.

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Cody

We need to. It's a different business, so we need to kind of build processes around that and

people around that, yeah.

Brett

That I understand, but if it works, then that's an opportunity.

Cody

Yeah, yeah.

Brett
