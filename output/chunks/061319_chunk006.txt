Speaker 3

Yeah.

Cody

We need to. It's a different business, so we need to kind of build processes around that and

people around that, yeah.

Brett

That I understand, but if it works, then that's an opportunity.

Cody

Yeah, yeah.

Brett

Remember, we never meant to have a a retail business without a big digital component. I

mean, the two things. Go together today, they.

Speaker 3

Yeah, they have to.

Brett

And at the moment you've got that and you'll you'll start collecting emails in the store if

you're not already. You're doing that now, are you? Are we? We're getting their e-mail.

Cody

Yeah, we're we're trying to. We should be doing more. We're doing a little bit of that. That's

where the 600. Emails that we have come from.

Brett

Well, it footwear can do it. Lingerie can do it where every 50% of the customers. We'll give

you 50% one in two.

Speaker

OK.

Cody

Give their e-mail.

Brett

Just by asking.

Speaker

Yeah.

Brett

Yeah, the other easy way to do it it is which is. You can. I'm surprised we're not doing it

already. His e-mail receipt so.

Cody

That's what we do.

Brett

Yeah. OK so. Yeah, yeah, but maybe you'll be absolutely surprised. I know it will shock you

and, but if you haven't already. Done it, you just. Ask ask them for their e-mail and they will.

Give it to you, yeah.

Cody

It's not. Can I have your e-mail? It's what's your e-mail.

Brett

It's what's your e-mail address.

Speaker

You.

Brett

And they'll give it. To you the. Footwear business we have, this is in a country that has 27

million people between Australia and New Zealand. We have 4.5 million.

Speaker 3

I love it. It's haven't.

Brett

Haven't paid a cent to get them just.

Speaker

That's.

Brett

100% true honey bit. Today you go down and talk to the your mates. They're they're one in

five. And I imagine they're doing better in Beverly Hills because they've got this focus,

although we'll see what happens. But we just opened in UTC.

Cody

Yeah, I saw that. Is that how did that go yesterday?

Brett

He talked on OK Stone and he didn't. Actual fact, I haven't seen the numbers. I've only saw

Sundays figures, which were fine. I haven't. They don't tell me. Don't care about me. I

mean, I won't take it personally, alright. So that's the story. It's all good news. It's all good

news. It's we need a bit more but it's. Yeah, we're in better shape than we were, right?

Cody

We are. Can I ask you two more quick questions so.

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Cody

I am. I made a comment to you a couple weeks ago that I I felt confident that it wasn't the

team. Causing the lack of sales. I actually and a little less confident in that statement now.

Because we kept getting complaints about the team not acknowledging people, now I am

working really hard to get them to do that and it's gotten much better. The funny thing that's

worked is like we've invented this little quirky game where if I'm in the store and I. Beat the

team to acknowledging the customer they have to do 3 laps around the store when the

customer leaves. If if they beat me to it, I'll do the lapse. So it's a little competition to see

they've all been really, it's been fun, they've enjoyed it, but it's we've gotten much better at

acknowledging people, right when they walk in the door. What's happening though is as

they get closer and they get to know each other more. Like you said, I think a while ago,

they're starting to hang out. Rather than.

Speaker

And.

Cody

Sell and be in the store working. So I think part of the problem is they've just like been

paying more attention to each other, especially when it's slow than they are to maintain the

store. My challenge is it's very clear when I am there that's not happening, but the second I

leave. It does and I don't know how to manage that when I'm not there.

Brett

Yeah.

Cody

Just wondering if you have any advice or ways to deal with that or how to schedule people

differently or something. It's yeah a lot more babysitting than I thought originally.

Speaker 3

I feel.

Brett

Yeah, yeah. OK. First thing is always say is done. Don't think that this is a problem that you

alone are facing or that it's anything to do with the. With you. So Cody, this is a huge

problem. That exists in almost all retail environments. It is a little urgent. I don't even know

why I say this to to you, so I'm not. Even gonna say. That it's it's Americans that generally

love to talk. They're very, very expressive. Culture. So it's a, it seems to be even a little

harder, but this issue really is it's it exists now. The only way to get around this? Is that you

have to hold people accountable and it's one of the reasons why turnover in retail is. Is so

high because you're bringing in people. Is that you've discovered that? Don't get the

complexities of business. Don't even understand the. That all they do is. You're being harsh

on because there's no customs in there. Why can't we talk to each other? There's no issue

there. They don't think about how what that leads to and and nor do you actually. Want to

teach? Teach them because it's a waste of time until you find somebody that does that

does get it, so you have to keep coming back. To. This is what's required of you because

they're cheating.

Speaker 3

Great.

Speaker

Yeah.

Brett

You you don't want to think that they're all cheating you, but they're cheating you so they
