to be sacked a couple of times before they rotate in and sometimes you never know when

you've got the guy. That's been sacked. Twice, and then finally they realize. Ohh ****. I'm

not at college anymore. I'm not. I'm not at home where I can. Do any atrocity and you know

the and. It's all unpopular to say all that, but that's what's going on. I mean, most

importantly, it's it's. It's you that's gotta feel hurts. Like you've gotta use a bit of because it's

a small team. You can you don't just use standards in this one you can use because you're

letting me down. Well, you, you you made a commitment to. And you and you made a

commitment to these customers. These customers are coming in and got issues. They

need your help. You need your full attention. That's why you're in this role. You promised

me that you know that sort of. And. They'll they'll get there, but may don't be. Afraid to fraud

them?

Cody

Yep.

Brett

Yeah, you'd be. You'd be amazed at a good firing model.

Speaker

Yes.

Brett

It's terrible to say, and it's not popular to say that particular in California, but you're seeing

the realities of what goes on here. I mean, it's. That simple I. Want you to how hard is that? I

want you. There's no skill. Required to I. Want you to acknowledge every customer with the

next time when they come in this tiny store where you can just look. At them and go.

Speaker 3

Hi, yeah.

Brett

High. And you can't get it. You're getting it 50% of the time or 75. Percent of the time, it's.

You should be out.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

And and just go. I will bludgeon you to death and you will either perform here as you

promised me in the interview, you know, because they made the commitment that, but

make sure you follow that up in writing. That's why the job description, the requirement,

the reason you keep following it up in your weekly staff. 0 tolerance. Every customer, every

time, every customer, every time we're here for the customer. Every customer that you just

keep repeat.

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Brett

Maybe even in California, it's not against the law to require people to do reasonable,

reasonable and appropriate requests and acknowledging every customer in a customer

service environment is still even in the great state of California. Legal.

Cody

All right. Well, I'm. I'm. I'm clear on. That.

Brett

Yeah. And that business will be better for point. And you can't say you're about the

customer.

Cody

Yeah. Yeah.

Brett

If you're not about the customer.

Speaker

Yeah.

Brett

You can say we're about the team member. Well, that's great. We now we have to be

decent and professional and proper, but we're about the customer and nowhere in that is

the team first. The team second, now that's been very. Graphic and crass about it, but

that's the reality.

Cody

Yep.

Brett

But make rest assured these issues. You can talk to any and every retailer in the DRC

group. And they'll. It's the same, but different in. Yeah.

Speaker 3

Hey.

Brett

And that's why that's why these guys and you know, 12 bucks. Yeah.

Cody

Yeah, exactly.

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Cody

Oh, by the way. Minimum wage is going up. I think it's 1350.

Brett

Yeah, it's going to be 15 either or.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

Something, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Cody

Which is a big, I mean, we're paying everyone 12 bucks for the most part. Now it's a pretty

big jump.

Brett

It it it's it's a craziness of, you know, it's a California thing. It's it's a crazy impost on

particularly businesses like ours. You know, it's just, it's just huge. But made a hot ate

yogurt just as a example. Just put their prices. Up 20%. Because of that.

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Brett

Because they, you know, all the people are. Yeah.

Cody

Yeah, interesting.

Brett

Umm. It's just better sort of meat. Every retailer has the same issue, so prices will rise.

Some somehow somewhere, prices will rise to, you know, cover the cost. It has to come

from somewhere.

Cody

Right.

Brett

Anyway, don't worry, Nathan. Texas is cheaper. When we get the. Text.

Cody

In Texas, yeah.

Speaker 3

Yeah, yeah.

Brett

All right. So what was that is was that? The final thing then?

Cody

Yeah. The only other things are I'm going to go ahead and move forward with the

accountant, the new accountant.

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Cody

I realize I haven't been sending you and Nico monthly financials if if you want, I can

continue to do that from what I. Have from them or.

Brett

And I don't do. Do not worry, Nico. At some stage or other. Queering me on it, but you.

Know we're we're. We're fighting now to get this right, but don't lose sight of that. We have

to pay our bills and you know, understand what's going on.

Cody

Yeah, definitely not. We're keeping track of everything. So the other thing is, you know, I

really think there's a lot of value in.

Brett

Yes. Yeah, as long as you're doing that.

Cody

Really digging into. Community building, influencer marketing partnerships. None of those

are quick fixes like changing the signage in the store, so I think we should continue to do

that.

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Brett

And I I think so too, it's. A I I. How much percent don't. Don't lose sight of that so. The digital

strategy, I mean, we're we're nowhere on it yet, but that's all what I lump under, you know,

digital influences, social media sales through the. Through the site. Connecting the whole

scene together, so don't lose sight of it. I mean, if you can get stuff going there. What I'm
