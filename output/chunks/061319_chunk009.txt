strategy, I mean, we're we're nowhere on it yet, but that's all what I lump under, you know,

digital influences, social media sales through the. Through the site. Connecting the whole

scene together, so don't lose sight of it. I mean, if you can get stuff going there. What I'm

more concerned about is we've got to have a foundation and then we'll build those

incremental things. But my ship, Haley Bailey. Haley. Haley. What's her name? Yeah, that.

That's it. You know, ship. Get her sent out to call the fan. She'd been back.

Cody

I don't think she's been back.

Brett

She bought everything she needed. Yeah. That's why we got to keep bringing.

Cody

I don't know if you've ever seen the movie Borat. You seen that movie? Funny Guy Sasha

Baron Cohen.

Brett

I don't think so. Should have I.

Cody

I don't know.

Brett

Yes, tell me.

Cody

It's a ridiculous movie, but it's very funny. Anyway, he's a very big actor. He came in the

store a couple of days ago and bought a bunch of stuff, which is nice. Yeah.

Brett

There you go. I mean, all all these actors, they got more problems than any.

Cody

Yep, I'm. I'm talking to a guy that works very closely with Lady Gaga. Do you know Lady

Gaga?

Brett

Hi mate. Yeah, come on. I'm not.

Cody

That bad? Yes, yes. So she is. She is.

Speaker 3

That's fair enough.

Cody

Not. Not notorious. She's dealt with mental issues for a very long time. Has her she just

announced a couple of days ago an Institute for mental health that she's funding.

Speaker 3

Oh.

Cody

And so I would love to get her involved and that would be huge.

Brett

Be that would be unbelievable. Yeah. Now you're talking well beyond the world of

influences.

Cody

Yeah, that's that's, I mean. Yeah, top influential person in the world.

Brett

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Cody

List. But yeah, I think I mean. I don't know. Let me fill it out and I'll get back to you, but that

would be the type of person I would say we should.

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Cody

Let her invest.

Speaker 3

Just.

Cody

A little bit to be a part of the business or something like that.

Brett

Made made 100% things like that. If you can pull that off. That that would be game

changing. Yeah. Yeah. When you work on that, that's. That's your. That's your gig. But we do

need all that comes under digital, in my view, and we and we haven't even we have. We're

nowhere on that yet. Yeah. In my experience, the cheapest way is to get this. Right. And

then we'll. Build that that out.

Speaker 3

Right.

Brett

Buddy and great work. Great work we're we're encouraged. We're back in business.

Cody

I'm good.
