Brett

Hey, bro, you're happy man.

Cody

You know. I'm but I'm I'm actually more stressed now that we're doing well for some

reason.

Speaker

Hello.

Cody

Like I don't. I don't want it to go away. It's it's like this angsty.

Brett

How the hell can I help you with that?

Cody

I was going to ask if you ever felt that way or not. Well. But yes, I'm I'm I am relieved that

this week was really good. I'm very.

Brett

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Where? I'm sure that I have felt that. But what I'd love you to focus

in on. Cause I I.

Brett

I think about this. It is a. And you're going to say it's easy. For me to do that. One way this is

a this is a challenge and we've really we've changed the game play and we've seen. 2030%

jump in our results for no extra.

Speaker

Effort. It's it's.

Brett

Quite amazing, isn't it? And so I. I try to stay focused on and it does actually intrigue me. It's

why I, you know, it's why I I really enjoy the the game of business. And so that's one way to

direct your energy as well. Look what happened. We did this, we did that.

Speaker

The the.

Brett

Products the same in the store. There's actually less of.

Speaker

That.

Brett

And we are clearly picked up the pace. What else did we change? And and then it then that

becomes deep learnings that that make you you know better and you know you paid me a

big compliment the other day. Of you know. To how how we should change it and think

about it and it will make a difference. Now, of course I've stumbled across, fell across,

make mistakes to to get to to the point where what you do makes a difference. Why does

one fail at doing the same thing as somebody else and and one succeed? You know, here's

a classic case. What the hell do we do differently that would cause such and? And then

what should stress you, if anything, make nothing should stress you. But what? Should

stress you is. Ship. What have we missed that will give us another 30% kicker? Because

what we've what you've seen is we haven't even got the concept right yet. So we can't even

worry about playing around with the things that will give you half a percent here and 2%

there, you know which we're we're not even at that stage yet so that. That and then it turns

it around from Archer. I don't want to lose this, but wow, how much more is there? And and

and how do we? Find that and. And and just sit. Well, well, I'll try this and I'll do that. Which

is what? It's called we're in trial mode anyway. Enough of that, Rick. I've got your good work

as always right in front of me. You got Monday probably. Worried the hell out of you, right?

Cody

Yeah, absolutely.

Brett

There there one week 1 we're back to where we were.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

If you look at the previous seven weeks, then. This the previous seven days. You know if 8-9

if if 900 is your is your worst. If that's our new base worst then.

Brett

We'll be OK, right?

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

Let's let's see.

Cody

Yeah, but pretty, pretty crazy numbers. I mean it's. Again, just I really feel like we just focus

on a little bit of product change, three things in store and put those decals up. But I think

the the decals have really been what? Has been drawing people in. And like I was like, I

was, uh, kind of aware we were converting very well in store. But the question is how do we

get people to stop what they're doing and come into the store? And I think those 4 words.

I've I've really done awesome job so.

Brett

I mean those small words. What is it about those 4 words? Cause that's that's the secret I

believe to our. What we're trying to do here, to our concept, to our idea.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

What do you think they're doing?

Cody

At a basic level, I think they're. Just resonating with people, they're just simple people.

Understand those words and. Like we have kind of assumed they are probably looking for

solutions for themselves or for somebody. I think the decompressed, discover delight was

just too soft. It doesn't explain anything and doesn't tell them what we're after. We might

have been able to do that once they were in the store, but I think. Having those words up

gets people in. Yeah, I mean.

Brett

That's so when you say it resonates with the what, where is it resonating?

Cody

Resonates in that, I don't know. It's it's something they need. It's something that at least is

intriguing enough to come in and check out what solutions we have. I guess I don't know, to

be honest with you. I've been in the store all week and it's just. Like more people have

come in that's been.

Brett

Yeah.

Brett

So I mean, come in. So I'm going to take your word for that because the data doesn't lie.

You've had more people or they've bought more. Now we've got the data to figure out

whether.

Brett

Lot of people have.

Brett

We've had more customers, so we know we've had more customers, right. But of course

we, yeah.

Cody

The amazing part like these. Oh, sorry.

Brett

We don't for sure know that more customers came in the store, but your your sense is that

that's for sure the case, right? So. Experience tells me that that will be true and then. Given
