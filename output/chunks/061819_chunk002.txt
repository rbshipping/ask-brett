we, yeah.

Cody

The amazing part like these. Oh, sorry.

Brett

We don't for sure know that more customers came in the store, but your your sense is that

that's for sure the case, right? So. Experience tells me that that will be true and then. Given

the fact that what we did did change was the call to action of the signage. So here's what. I

would like you to think about and and I actually believe these are. This for you is going to be

hopefully something that you will have as a core learning that will stay with you for the rest

of your life. At least the rest of your life where you need to be a merchant, where we're

where we're actually involved in connecting. People with products selling stuff to them,

services or product. So what I learned is that.

Brett

People.

Brett

Then. We we don't sell products. We do sort of sell needs. And uh. But we really sell. We're

connecting deeply emotional. It's what I've never found the right word for it. Which is why

you're struggling with it. Is that you know, because I say we sell emotion, we sell on an

emotional connection. And then it's like, well, geez, what does the hell? Does that mean

but and? The woods. Stress, anxiety, pain have resonated emotionally. They've emotionally

connected. At a deep. Level, which even customers won't be able to articulate. And that's

that's why our stuff has got nothing to do with price. Why price is not the first cause of

action. So we're saying pain and. None of this is. Is a surprise to me. That as soon as you

get that emotional connection you get, you'll get sales. You'll get people that want to. That

that wants it, because as soon as someone's emotion, they connected they they just got to

have it and provided they got the money. They're they're gonna go and and and. Do it so.

That's the thing that you've got to remember that what we're looking for, we so Levisa

doesn't sell jewellery. It sells an emotional connection to whatever this piece of jewelry

represents in a person's mind. Right. And it represents love or friendship. Or closeness or a

good time. Or a great coffee. Honey. But it is a bit easier to to understand because it deeply

connects with that. Sort of love. Sex. It's the you know, they're all emotional words that.

Speaker

And.

Brett

And wherever you're not relying on price, you're relying on fashion, so things like we don't

sell fashion.

Brett

We do but.

Brett

We sell the emotional connection to what? That what that person wants to be and how

they want to represent themselves and how they feel. But this is going to help them get

there because humans are very complicated.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

People. So have you used the word? It was all too soft. So to me, that's exactly what's

happened. And that was sort of the plan we formulated. We need to that go go harder on it.

So can I. The reason I want to push this down as a. There's a lesson. Is this he asleep? That

you sent out has gone back to being soft. Yeah, you wrote, said the word soft. I wrote the

word up here. Soft meat. So it feels to me like because.

Brett

Of who you are.

Brett

You're you're pulling it back to. The the sort of a way that you want it to you feel it should

be. And so.

Brett

I've got here.

Brett

You've gone back to being soft. Speak to the emotion, not to the intellect.

Cody

Yes.

Brett

So this was very much an intellectual speak to the same as that sign says, pain, stress,

sleep, speak to the speak, to the emotion, to.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

Does any of that? Vaguely former.

Cody

Yes. That's exactly what I wanted to send that for you to to you for I wanted that that

feedback. The question was how. And what's useful is it focusing on? Things like the

statistics about these definition or is it more focused on? Solutions for people or things

that they can do to improve their sleep or. What's I guess my question is, what is the point?

What are? What are we trying to achieve with these in store science? Because I know we

talked about credibility and establishing ourselves as as a thought leader or as someone

who knows what we're talking about in the space, but.

Brett

We got to.

Brett

Do that so.

Brett

We've got to have, we've got.

Brett

To have all that. Umm. But first of all got to. Sell stuff now. Part of how we will sell that is to

to, to be the thought leaders to to be the leaders, to be the authority on this stuff. So we

have to back it up with. If you like to use that word intellect, we've got to back it up. When

we're not, there's no ******** in what we're doing.

Speaker

Yeah.

Brett

But when we're talking about selling, this is a sales document. This this so this is a this is a

call to action. This is a silent salesperson. The only reason we're writing this is to make sure

that we can get you to. Do something that will take. The pain away. So what you what the

signage. Has told us. We're connecting to that raw emotion. People are. They they see

prime. And we're speaking to them like, thank goodness, somebody. I'm I'm in pain now.

They don't even know they're in pain. Some of the a lot of this is at a very deep subliminal

level. So what we're not doing with sleep is we're not trying to say here's how you have a
