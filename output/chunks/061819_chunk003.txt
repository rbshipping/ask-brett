They don't even know they're in pain. Some of the a lot of this is at a very deep subliminal

level. So what we're not doing with sleep is we're not trying to say here's how you have a

wonderful night's sleep. And you'll feel refreshed in the morning. It's like you need to sleep

to take. Away the pain. All right. That's the. So that's how we've got to connect, because

that's what the change in the last week is reconfirmed. That we're connecting emotionally.

We don't want you to have a good night or you'd have a good night's sleep. Want to get rid

of the pain? And one of the steps to that. His bloody sleep. Yeah, easy to say. So I want you

to have a good night's sleep so we can remove the pain from you. You know, it's one one of

the steps now.

Cody

You would literally say that.

Brett

I don't know. I'm not. I'm literally saying that to you. But remember this subliminal stuff.

Like you said. What are those four things? What 4 words we put up on the window?

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

Call people in. It's the same way here in this this has gone back to your old way. Yeah. So

you wanna you wanna? So I'll. I'll just. Do you know? I'm not here for an intellectual. I didn't

come into the store to be told I need to sleep better.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

I I came into the store because you told me you could help me sleep so that I could. My

body could repair. I could take the pain away or I would. I I'd stop feeling depressed. In all,

all those things that we. Don't talk about. That are causing yes, we can't solve snoring so

we don't even. Talk about snoring, yeah. Now there is a moment where you would have an

intellectual pamphlet. So for the for our credibility, there is a moment where. This might

work, but the first thing that you're trying to do, Cody, is.

Brett

That.

Brett

This. Is you pull them into the store now. Keep that. You got me in here because I'm feeling

the pain. I'm not telling anybody about this, but I'm hurting or I'm. I'm hurt. I'm hurting for in

the moment or I'm hurting forever or or whatever it is. And that's why they're coming in now.

Come this way. Here's how we take the pain away. Or the. Well, here's the stuff. You can

that. That might help. And so snoring, we don't give a **** about snoring because we can't

solve storing that doesn't mean it's got credibility. You might. The.

Speaker

We.

Brett

We let people know that that's part of the problem. If you're a snorer, but you didn't come

in because. You're a snorer. Incoming that snow because you know, because you're snow.

You came in because you got pain and stress and anxiety which is causing. Lack of sleep

because you're wearing or whatever. So you've got to find a way to to do that. So I don't

mean we we shouldn't have pamphlets that step out maybe a little bit of this, but then

there needs to be. Here's here's what you do, and we need to reference the pain and

anxiety in the same way that the signage references it without saying it. Because you didn't

tell everybody that.

Brett

They're they're a mess.

Brett

But he he didn't put company. If you're a mess. But that's what. Yeah, I'm now. I'm over. I'm

over. Emphasizing you know how we with honey, but we. We start with the bedroom, but it

will end up in sexual activity. That's the.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

But of course, we pull right back from that in the reality of it all, but that's the that's the

that's the hard hitting bit. That's what you can't lose. You gotta keep having that hard hitting

bit and it'll everybody will soften it off themselves. Any of that makes sense?

Cody

Yeah, it does. It does. I'm just trying to think about exactly what the signage will say. I get

what the I I now get what the point of. It is, I'm just thinking. Literally about the words and

how it's going to. Yeah. Because by the way I have I have a point on here. Here.

Brett

It's at least worth.

Cody

Chatting about I know I don't want to complicate things, but I've had a couple of the

companies that we sell actually asked well, how do you get around compliance issues and

making health claims if you're really not allowed to. Put. Pain on things because you're

claiming that you're going to have a solution for. But. And I know that we're a retailer and

we're not making those products yet, but. There is some complexity with this, so I I just

don't want to. Yeah. Again with one store, we're not going to get shut down at all. It's just

something to think about. In terms of how we're acting.

Brett

Yeah.

Brett

Get up out. Keep it. I mean you, you're going to think about 1000 things every week, you

know, that's that's the nature of the business. I would deprioritize that stuff for the moment

because we just said pain. We didn't say anything about pain. Haines a word. Or, as we all

as we know, we know because we're the experts in here that.

Brett

There are a lot of people out there.

Brett

That will will resonate with the word pain. Now we're talking about mental pain. Even

harder to define than than, you know, mental health. What's the reverse of mental health?

Well, of mental pain, right. What's the what's the mental Wellness? Well, it's mental hurt

that that's we don't have to worry about that cause what we're trying to do here and and
