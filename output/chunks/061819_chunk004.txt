harder to define than than, you know, mental health. What's the reverse of mental health?

Well, of mental pain, right. What's the what's the mental Wellness? Well, it's mental hurt

that that's we don't have to worry about that cause what we're trying to do here and and

we're taking a huge. Step I think. In understanding what people. Trying to solve what

problem are we trying to solve for them? And you've spoken directly to the pain sleep

anxiety. You put it in their face and they've gone. Yes. And they've come in now. We've got

to complete the transaction. So as long as I agree with you that we will have to be

conscious of that, we have to do the right thing. We can't pretend to be something that

we're not. We can't give advice that we're in no position to give. You know, we aren't going

to do that. And but what we what we are trying to do at the moment is find out we're not,

we're not no one in the store. Well, tell me if.

Brett

Yeah.

Brett

You're not trying to say here. Take this and it will solve your problems.

Brett

But.

Brett

And and we don't actually make any of the product. So you know we we don't have any of

the the the liability what we do is we have a credibility we can't just make **** up. But

that's not really our issue at the moment. So I'm just trying to say push that aside for the

moment, it doesn't mean it's not. Important to push it aside. Why we figure out? You know,

sleep. The causes of. Lack of sleep. And not forget snoring. You know you could put snoring

in there, but put down depression. Put down anxiety, put down worries, put down stress.

Put down. Because. Yeah, that's true, right?

Cody

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Brett

Now, if you're laying in bed with your partner and and you're the the guy that snoring his

head off keeping that well, you know. That's that's keeping. Now you don't know this, but I

wear a snoring dental guard.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

Because. I've been doing it for 10 years because occasionally I'd wake up in the morning

and Ness was in another room. So she wasn't sleeping because. This racket I was making

was uh, so I went and got the sleep guard and solved my storing problem. But we're talking

about here. We're talking to the person who can't sleep, not because their babies keeping

her awake or their husband's snoring, or we're talking, you know, that's, that's our gig,

right?

Cody

Yeah, I wanted to show you. A post I made on Instagram. OK, so. This I've I've been

experimenting. We we started posting pictures of products. You know, getting 22 likes, 28

likes, 26.

Brett

Yeah.

Brett

Got because that's all soft Mandy Pandy.

Cody

This one I posted we have 790.

Brett

See.

Speaker

OK.

Brett

Cody, you're a genius, buddy. There's the lesson. You put it into action right there. Bang.

We speak scrap. What? I think I need what I really. Need self acceptance. With their self

acceptance because of what you just did there, you could put that up on our. Window as

well. Self acceptance and it would have that same. That's what you did. That's what. That's

the signage and you've just done it online 21/22/24, which is all your friends. To. Yeah, to

800, you don't have 800 friends, so I know that's legit.

Cody

Yeah, that's that means people are actually sharing it with each other. And liking it. And

then so we started to do more of that. You know this has 60, but again, now let's compare it

to 20 and these are they're starting to. You know 50 is better, but yeah, this this one for

whatever reason. Really reset.

Brett

So like again.

Cody

My question showing you this is, is this a sign that needs to be in the store and we we print

this out and put it somewhere? Is is this kind of the type of thing?

Brett

Now you got.

Brett

You're you are a genius, Gabby. You are absolutely.

Speaker

Yeah.

Brett

What I think I need, what I really need and then the third page has to say. It has to sell.

Remember, we're selling. So what I really need is self acceptance. Here's how. You don't.

What I what I think I need what I really need.

Brett

UM.

Brett

You, you, you'd. You'd pie on that and and you'll get better at it. So it what you just did?

There is. You got data. That said, that now you got to think deeply and put this into your

mind. I'll do the same. That you've got. First line of duty to do this is. To figure out why did

they like that, you and you can't stop until. There's two ways to think about this. When you

do one that gives you that response. You cannot stop thinking about it till you go haha. I

know exactly why that worked. And then you look at, you look at the things that do really

well and the things that do really awfully. And they're the two things you have to not stop.

Thinking about until you know. Why that worked and why one didn't so that you can of

course do more of the stuff that. Works and less of. The stuff that doesn't work. That's

marketing its product.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

That's exactly it. So instead of that. You do that. Self acceptance. Now we're speaking to

the true anxiety of people, people that don't feel worthy. The social media that makes them

feel like they're missing out. You're not. We're on our all head. I mean we're we're off and

running.
