the true anxiety of people, people that don't feel worthy. The social media that makes them

feel like they're missing out. You're not. We're on our all head. I mean we're we're off and

running.

Cody

Well it it is. It's harder than it looks to actually say what you're trying to say, you know. It is.

Speaker

Well.

Brett

Why do you reckon there's so few billionaires in the world? Is it supposed to be easy?

Cody

No, but it is. It feels good when you get it right, that's.

Brett

Sure, don't make those endorphins are running around like crazy.

Speaker

Is that the?

Brett

Right word the endorphins. Is that the right chemical? I can't remember one of them.

Anyway. Something's running around. Yeah.

Cody

OK so. That makes more sense I'm going to. I'm going to keep working on those signs and

I'd like to send them to you for your thumbs up before I get anything printed.

Brett

Yeah.

Cody

Uh.

Brett

So self acceptance and you know we spoke to. The teacher the other day, they didn't like

the idea of pain. We're, we're now convinced. We've gotta have these stronger words. So

with self acceptance be. You know, because you just discovered another word that

connects and that and you just got to keep using these words and you know, you got to, we

got to keep having our library of words that connect and delete the ones that don't. Yeah.

Cody

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's interesting. Having that on the shirt.

Brett

But what what?

Brett

You've confirmed to me this weekend through this because we don't give a **** what our

team thinks they will wear. What the bloody hell we know connects with the customers.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

All right. So maybe you're you're on the roll. Keep improving this bill with urgency. You're

playing around with that stuff that's. Let's go.

Cody

All right. Sorry, let me just take a couple notes here real quick.

Brett

Hey, Julia, right. Cody is writing the notes. Did you find that? Lisa's weekly results so I can

find this store? Yeah. Pull that up. We're looking for. This is commonly referred to as

Sherman Oaks, right? Yeah. You can find. Find for me the US and. It's about 20 pages down

from US and U.S. dollars.

Speaker

Hi. OK.

Brett

Sherman, Alex. Or I might stick. To your agenda.

Cody

For two seconds.

Brett

So I might say that again.

Cody

You you want to talk about that Sherman Oaks property for two seconds?

Brett

Maybe whenever you get to it. I was just pulling. Up. The data.

Cody

All right, so. The big issue of big thing I wanted to talk to you about was some team

challenges I'm having.

Brett

I. Can see that.

Cody

So this conflict between these two girls has come to a head. It's really. It's just ridiculous.

They're both, you know, 18 year old high school drama. I don't know. What? They knew

each other before. They have some vendetta against each other. They've both now

requested not to be scheduled. To work with the other one, which is a disaster. For me and.

Luckily, Dora is leaving for a month. Anyways, at the end of the week. Uh. Which is good,

but it's still both of them have come to me, basically tattletaling all of the other things that

the other is doing wrong. And and and I just it's rubbing off on me. It's rubbing off on the

other team the the issue. The only issue I have no problem firing both of them. I I think if

that's what it takes, great. We'll do it. My issue is Maddie is by far the best salesperson and.

She would fundamentally shift the turnover we're doing in product. A lot of the sellers that

we're selling like crazy are her favorite products, and she's completely responsible for it.

She's also, in my opinion. The most available one of the most responsible, she comes 30

minutes early to every shift and and I think she adores the store and would stay with us

forever, so that that's my challenge is she's rough around the edges and she's creating

conflict and she's got a history. But. You know she's doing a good job. So I this is what I just

I wanted to figure out with you because I I don't know what to do and it's gotten to the point

where we have to do something. It's we can't let it continue on.

Brett

Yeah.

Brett

To come back to, there's two parts to this. You've got to deal with the immediate issue, but

mostly what you've got to learn that that we need to to do here is figure out because this

will not be the first time that this happens. It's it's, it's part and parcel. People, they have

personalities.

Brett

Ah.

Brett

They're supposed to leave them at the door, check the baggage at the door. Leave it there.

You're now working. Pick it up. On your way out. Whatever issues you have.

Professionalism at all times. So you have to start to make sure that the way that we comply

is to ensure that we write these things down as we learn. Them. And that. You every new

start reads it. Understands it and signs off that they've read and understood. This is the way

we behave in the workplace now. There's good and bad in the laws and. The laws demand

that we create. Hi. Proper working place, whatever the definition of proper is, but proper

work environment. And what you're learning is most of the time the bad workplaces are

caused by bad people rather than the generally conceived idea that it's bad employees. So

you have to be able to work. You have to be able to be professional. This stuff of them
