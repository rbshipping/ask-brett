mid you'll you'll get used to dealing with this issues. You'll get to the point where you'll be

able to do this off the back of your head. Well, that's not gonna work, guys. You guys have

got, you know, like, one day to sort this out or I'll sort it out. You don't want that. Make

peace with. Each other or. And you know, it's it's all done in like 30 seconds type stuff. That

I can imagine every time they ring you up or they start texting you. It's like Jesus. I gotta

listen to. This **** again.

Cody

Yeah, it's not fun.

Brett

Yeah, it's never funny.

Speaker

Yeah.

Brett

Right.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

So it made any of that you you knew all that right?

Cody

Well, no, I think that's that's that's what I'll do. Yeah, I am. I'm honing my. Gut feeling about

some of this stuff? Because this is still very early for me and I haven't done a lot of it before.

I'm trying to make the best decisions around. Not only just how to react in the situation, but

also the decision about who you keep. I go back and forth about Maddie versus Dorex. I

think it's an interesting case study.

Brett

Right. Yeah, this case study.

Cody

Yeah, because Maddie is. It's hard for me to ignore the things that Dora mentioned that

Matt is doing. No, right, just like it's hard for me to ignore the things that Matty mentioned.

Dora is doing wrong. So again, they're they're not. They're both not perfect. I just want to

make a decision. Like you're saying that actually creates culture in the company. Because

if if I choose to keep Maddie effectively, what I'm saying is. We value selling over everything

else. Right. Which is which is fair, but it does come at a cost, which is Maddie is not as fun

to work with or not as. Not as uh, I guess. Refined as you would expect an employee to be. I

mean, she's very she's tattooed, she's rambunctious. She has a lot of energy. She's the one

that I've had to tell not to sit five times. She's. On her phone, sometimes she's clearly not

perfect. She has a lot of things to work on.

Brett

Yeah. So it is, can I can I? Help you with that. The way in which to motivate people, teach

them. Help Maddie be better. Yeah, which will help us.

Brett

How?

Speaker

Ah.

Brett

But also make sure that we're not compromising on because you can't sit down. There is.

That's non negotiable. You can't be on your phone. That's non negotiable. Yeah. And. And

you're right that this is non negotiated and try not to ever utter the word non negotiable and

then make it and then let it be negotiable because that's that just destroys it but.

Speaker

Right.

Brett

With Maddie, when you write this stuff about Maddie, when you said it. I can see you being

here forever. I can see that you like it. You're attitude towards showing up. And but then

you had. That nanny I I want, I want. To help you. Your attitude towards the standards and

disciplines that we must have to make our business successful, not IE no sitting down or

being on the phone. Because. That's you can either choose to explain the reason, or you

can just choose to make it a standard. And you tell her. But I can't. These are the things

that you have to improve and then you go. So you got two weeks to improve that. You'll

never sit down again, and you'll never be on your phone again. And Maddie, I need your

commitment to that. I need you to say yes. I'm with you, Cody. And then when we got a

deal, then you can be the I can see you being an area manager. You know what? Whatever

whatever she wants in her career. So don't be afraid to pull them up and you must tell them

I love you for this. This is letting you down. Stop that. And you'll zoom.

Cody

Yeah.

Speaker

It.

Brett

It's they're 18 years of age. This shouldn't stop, no matter at what age. But at 18 years of

age, you just say do more of that. Do none of that.

Speaker

Yeah.

Brett

Have I got your agreement, Maddie? You just look and say yes, then you say, alright, I'm

gonna send this an e-mail and you're gonna write back. Yes, you know, so it's. So. The the

the e-mail thing is so it's. On the record, that's just to protect us from. One day when she

says. You. You. Fire and she. Says no one ever told me that. I wasn't lying. Sit there.

Whatever.

Cody

Yeah, I wanted to ask you because at the beginning we had everyone look at a code of

conduct that was taken from Levi's stuff.

Brett

Mm-hmm.

Brett

Yeah.

Cody

And kind of like. What we learned at the store at the beginning, it was soft compared to

what I think it needs to be, which is don't sit down, don't be on your phone, don't **** ***

other people. Like all those things that we're talking about. You think it's? The right thing for

me to put those on a piece of paper and have everyone sign it again as a different thing. Or

is that a weird?

Brett

Not only do I think it's the right thing, it is the only way. For you as A1 store operator to

behave and it'll be that way until we get to, you know, 40 stores where you have to then

have all this. It says the same thing, but it's because you're putting your personality into it.

And then I would tell you that we, we have a duty these days. Being that. Clear. You will not
