have all this. It says the same thing, but it's because you're putting your personality into it.

And then I would tell you that we, we have a duty these days. Being that. Clear. You will not

sit down. You will not be on your phone on personal calls. You, you will. And so this, this

human needs to be a living, breathing document that needs to be resigned probably every

month. It's just a refresher because it's all it's almost need you. You don't wanna send it

out every time you add something to it. But but every time. You learn something. Peculiar

to. The store or peculiar to what you want. Provided what we want is within, you know,

reasonableness, and you've got to do that so that you keep control of the culture, the

standards and disciplines not have 18 year olds thinking because we you you come out of

the millenniums where it's a group. It's. Look, let let's let's all figure this out together right

now. Really what you're doing is you're trying to give the guys. We'll figure it out together,

but then you will make the the final decision. Because you're already learning that these

guys aren't capable of thinking. About the whole. Right. You're you're you're thinking about

you. Who is capable of that? But they're not. They're 18 year olds that can't figure out why

they can't have a blue between in your school. Yeah, I.

Cody

Mean, alright, great. Clear on that. You got. So that was the agreement note and the team

issues thing summer schedule again has just been impossible. I need to hire a couple

more people. We just had one of the seven I had leave and officially resign and go back to

San Francisco for the summer. So we're now down to 6. Right.

Brett

There's a thing that you want to put up on top of your. Stick it somewhere on your. PC there

or whatever you're working on that says always be recruiting.

Cody

Yeah. It is a. It is full out, isn't it? You said that to me at the beginning and I didn't

understand what it meant. But I get it.

Brett

Yeah, it gives you a different perspective of people and employment. And so up until now,

you've mostly got your perspective from.

Cody

Is.

Brett

Now you're seeing it first, you know first hand.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

But I don't want you'd be disillusioned once you do all this, it gets very easy to, I mean. That

that a a positive way to think about this is for you to think.

Brett

How do I? Create the framework.

Brett

That tells people how they can do a good job. So you you, you're actually making it easy for

them and if you try to think about it that way.

Brett

What? What have?

Brett

I got to tell these guys so they can do a good. Job. And then there's another thing about and

then I've got to remove any of the impediments that stopped them from, you know, being

able to. Do a good job. One of the first things is did you tell them the standards and

disciplines? Did you tell them the values so that they can understand it? Not in Mamby

pamby you know, mission statement stuff. So then you get down answering your own

question. I don't want them to sit down. I have to tell them. And I have to tell them if they do

sit down, they're gonna get high. Yeah. That's that's the deal because. And you don't really

want people starting for you. Who don't get that? Yeah, but you would never sit here fear. At

18, you would have never sat here.

Speaker

No.

Brett

Or if you did. Somebody said to you, you would have thought, OK, if somebody would have

kicked the crap out of you for it and told you ever do that again, you're out of here. You

would have said. Ohh, that's unfair. You would have got hurt and you would have probably

reacted defensively for a second. Then you would have had a moment when. Huh. OK.

Yeah, I'll get that. Customers want wanna see you paying attention. I get that you're paying

me money. You want me to be on my game?

Speaker

Yeah.

Brett

Not everybody's like you. They need to be told straight up front. You can't do that. And then

you'll get it and the ones that can't do it and do not be afraid to move them on.

Speaker

Yeah.

Cody

That's back to my door. And Maddie thing. Dora has followed every rule not done anything

wrong? Been perfect as far as I can tell, Maddie has broken all the rules and find new rules

that don't exist to break and is frustrating.

Speaker

Good.

Brett

Yeah. So you've got to address that within her because you know for sure it will stop her

from succeeding if she if she continues to do that. So the right thing to do, because I know

that if the right thing resonates with you, the right thing to do is to tell them, hey, Maddie.

You don't change that behavior. You won't last in this job or your next job, and I want to

help you do that because I. See good in you. But you can say all these things without being,

you know, I'm trying to take away. Your First Amendment rights. To you know you and then,

with Dory, you tell it and you do everything right. But but I need you to. I need you to sell. So

if you if you haven't done, if you're not a doctor, I can't let you operate. It doesn't matter

how great your intent is or your attitude is. If you're not a doctor, I don't care. You're a good

guy. And and you followed all the rules.
