Brett

They we call them that.

Brett

But.

Brett

They're they're not. The regional manager handles these people issues and the data

integrity issues. Now you do have some just because.

Cody

Interesting.

Brett

You can't pay that somebody that 50 grand. That's 60 grand that's required. And second of

all, if they they generally don't want to end up in, they'll move on quickly as soon as they.

Go on pretty. Good at this, they'll. Move to A to a bigger store so. UM.

Brett

But then I think.

Brett

You can take that first step if you think that. We might as well take it now. We gotta take it

at some stage. And I feel we're we're feeling a lot more confident right today. Yep. Yeah.

OK. So give it a go.

Speaker

So.

Cody

Where? Where do you find someone like that? Where do you look for? Is that you steal

another ASMR from a different store? Do you? So.

Brett

Generally speaking, you you're generally speaking, you would. I'm you'd ask for a store

manager. Because everybody always. Goes for a job higher than everybody thinks that

they're better than they are. You know that whole thing about 80% of the population thinks

they're above average. That's. UM. So you try to. Find a manager, not a, not an assistant

manager. But you'll find. Then it'll be people that think they're capable of being managers.

So they're looking for the. Increase I'd, I'd advertise. That's what I would be doing on, you

know, online, but. So.

Brett

Then. So the.

Brett

Always be recruiting, so if you're made steal from other retailers. If you have to one day

they'll do it to you and.

Brett

You'll hate it, but.

Brett

You see somebody that's good that likes the store because people like to work in places

that. Resonate with them. Most people like that.

Speaker

Yeah.

Cody

So is this is this technically considered a full time role versus a part time because

everyone's technically a part time casual right now? 0.

Brett

So one of. The things that is hard to do but successful. When it works. Is an idea for you

that I. May have shared with you before.

Speaker

But.

Brett

Some of the best people we could get for our store in Lavista does this is that you get

someone that's at college university. That because at college and university they're mostly

doing like one day or two days or three days, and you find that quality people that aren't

ever going to be retailers but are they're very capable of. And. They if they have got 25

hours. That they can manage the store and work in the store, but they can manage it so

they can take the sick calls and they the you know, the ring in at the end of the day. And.

And and and the start of the day. And you know that sort of stuff. And they're happy to do it.

They work really well. So you're actually getting somebody that's at higher quality. But just

looking for. Came to I'm the store manager while I'm starting to be, you know, whatever. I

assume it's that way in America where you know, somebody going to. You know, a 20 year

old or a great 19 year old. Who's going to college? It's not. You know, some of them have

pretty. Pretty easy. What do you call it? Easy schedules.

Cody

Yeah. I I don't know. I I just think about that one. It feels like the college kids we have are

the ones that are least. The the least committed to the store because it's just something

they're doing on the side, probably be different. If you reframed it as you're managing the

store, but.

Brett

Yeah.

Cody

Yeah. The the ones that we've had so far, I would not feel comfortable.

Brett

Yeah. Yeah. OK.

Brett

In which case, yeah, it's it's a full time job that you're looking for somebody for.

Speaker

Well.

Cody

Yeah, and. Do you have a couple extra minutes? I know we're overtime now.

Brett

Hey, John, you're good.

Cody

Do you look for? Leadership qualities in a person like this, do you look for the ability to

conflict resolve or is it really just? Can you handle reordering products, setting the roster

and dealing with scheduling issues? What's the?

Brett

And I would never let them do the roster because they get conflicted with the people they

like. The people that ohh, I need the extra work. I can't work here.

Cody

OK.

Brett

All that, never let them do their roster. But what you're looking for is somebody who's got a

great attitude. That's that's. That's all that ever is. Shiny eyes, great attitude that wants to

do the job and is is prepared to set a pace.

Speaker

Yeah.

Brett

Follow the rules and. Yes, generally you're looking for people that. Can lead. But there is

also an element of a a good person who's dedicated to. Doing everything exactly right,

which doesn't always make them a good leader. But people see that that, that the rest of

the teams see that they're committed to this store, they run a good store, they follow the

the rules, everything works, someone turns up and says today we're doing this, this and

this and this. That's your jobs to get done. Now they don't always necessarily are great

leaders, but they're good processed people, but they can still lead by the the the respect

they gain from she's got this store very organized. She's a bit too. She's not a whole lot of

fun, but. The store the store functions well, type stuff, and there's there's a balance

between those two types of people.

Cody

Yeah. So it's less that they're necessarily a great salesperson, which they should be ideally,

but it's more about.

Speaker

Right.
