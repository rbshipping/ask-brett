fun, but. The store the store functions well, type stuff, and there's there's a balance

between those two types of people.

Cody

Yeah. So it's less that they're necessarily a great salesperson, which they should be ideally,

but it's more about.

Speaker

Right.

Brett

They still have to sell, so they put they're more efficient sellers rather than flamboyant

sellers. You know, they're like. The add on is. I will do the add on and I will be successful at

it, but it's more methodical than it is creative.

Cody

Gotcha.

Brett

They, they, they still have to sell number one thing is you need. How do we meet our?

Targets we have to sell.

Cody

Yeah. OK.

Brett

But we actually have to dust and data integrity and clean the store and repack the shelves

and re merchandise and read the weekly memo.

Cody

Yeah. Are they in charge of reordering products?

Brett

I wouldn't let them do that either. They're they're they're very. Did you? You're asking

somebody to? You you're putting too much stress on them to do.

Brett

That.

Cody

What? What exactly would they? Be. Other than. What they're doing now?

Brett

That's why they're not really managers.

Cody

Right.

Brett

And somebody that really wants to be a manager, you'll be in conflict with anyway. But now

with, you know, getting stuff done in, you know, making sure that somebody's trained,

making sure that that somebody doesn't sit down like that's. That's why you're looking for

the great attitude. You don't sit down. And. And so Maddie would not dare to sit down while

she was there. And I would. And she would deal with Maddie. If she did sit down now, you

would probably have to oversee that or coach her. But and maybe you know, you know, sit

down. In. This store, you know, just able to say that.

Cody

Just kind of a bit of an authority figure.

Speaker

Yeah.

Brett

Now.

Cody

OK.

Brett

And they're there. They're not a dime a dozen, but they're, you know, they're they're not like

eagles. They're they're more than seagulls, but they're less than eagles.

Speaker

OK.

Cody

All right. So real quick. We'll run through the last couple of things. We can talk Westfield

fashion square. They approached me. They they have a couple of stores. I just wanted to

see how Lovisa was doing there. I hadn't heard about this center before. I've never been

there. I know that with. If we keep up this performance for the next. Couple of weeks or

month we should probably re pick up the conversation around next few stores. So. Always,

always looking at.

Brett

Yeah.

Brett

It the chairman performs. It's OK. So I'll give you an idea, Glenn. Last week Glendale did

13,000. Cerritos did 17,000 del Armo did 11,000 bring them all? Did 13,000. Sherman Oaks

did 11,000. So at the bottom, but not a disaster. Irvine Spectrum did 8000 did 9000 Mission

Diego did 9000 Roseville. That's in San Francisco. And those others are San Francisco

stores. So that gives you a sense it's it's. It's not spectacular, but it's not bad.

Speaker

OK.

Brett

What are so would we be there? Possibly.

Cody

Maybe not for store number 2.

Brett

Didn't do much more. It's d'alema delamar.

Cody

Say that one more time. They're not what?

Brett

It's del arma. It's the same as del Arma. Let me have a look at.

Cody

By the way, there was a another shooting at Del Amo. You guys get any hear about that

happening? Yeah. Anyways, so I I'll just keep learning now and see what happens. All right,

so we don't have any meetings planned for the next.

Brett

No, we do. I've just told Julia to put you in for two weeks.

Cody

In two weeks, OK.

Brett

Yeah, I'm just, Madam. I'm taking a month off, but for you and I will schedule a call. Julie is

going to do that, OK? I mean, what what we're doing here is too important. We're we're right

on the cusp of things. So meeting the the KPI's are just a matter of let's let's let's keep

pushing. What we've got here. See if we can't squeeze another 10 or 20% out of it. And then

we then we've got some real, real good basis to make proper decisions.

Cody

All right. Perfect. The last note was around BRC University in August. Is that something? I

should I should be out or. Depends.

Brett

I would love you to be there because you'll sit through the High Focus Day topic and then

the the university is just the the the day on culture, full day about culture, what it means.

So it would absolutely be worthwhile. I think you should try to be there if you can.

Cody

OK. All right. Well, next time we should talk about. Because because I still don't really feel.

I feel like this is my newborn baby. So leaving town for an extended period of time. I have no

idea how to do that yet, so by August, will I I would like to.

Brett

OK, I I understand. So let's not make the decision. Let's say it would be good for you to go,

but yeah, I'm not. I I'm with you and it's still this is. This is like where where we're we're

going again and we're figuring out. It's really strange isn't because we're not selling

anything different. It's it's it's. But we're speaking differently and we're connecting with

different cast. We're not actually, we're not. I don't think we're connecting with a different

customer. We've actually just connected.

Cody

Yeah. Really strange.

Brett

Now we got to. Figure out what to do with that connection.

Speaker

Yeah.

Cody

All right.

Brett

Alright, honey, it's great work and whatever you do, please. I mean easy last gift. Easy to
