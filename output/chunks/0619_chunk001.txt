Speaker

Morning.

Cody

Morning.

Brett

Hey buddy, I was on the other I somehow or other, I was on the wrong zoom.

Cody

Ohh good. How you doing?

Brett

So I was, you know, here's a compliment to you. I looked into. No, it's 1102. Cody has never

been late. Once in his entire life. Anyway, I was on the wrong wrong one, that's so sorry

about that.

Cody

All good.

Brett

You are an extraordinary man of action, I. I I don't know what I expected, but I'm not sure. I

expected to get this such clarity of thought so quickly, so well done.

Cody

Oh, thanks. Yeah, we don't we don't have time to sit around.

Brett

And that's why I love you. Just the urgency is the key to success.

Cody

Yeah.

Speaker 3

So.

Brett

Hold on, man, I've somehow I've something's going wrong. Now I can see you. Had a great

week. It was a long weekend, right something.

Cody

Was this past one? No, that was the. Yeah. Yeah, it's the previous one.

Speaker

Yeah.

Brett

It was a Holiday Monday.

Cody

Right, yeah.

Brett

Yeah, yeah. Meet the meditation chair. It looks it looks like a miniature chair or something. I

don't.

Cody

Have you seen? I know I need to put a picture up of what it actually looks like to sit in it.

Cause it's different.

Speaker 3

I gotta I gotta fight over there and it looks like what?

Brett

What is that?

Speaker 3

Like for kids, it just looks.

Cody

Yeah, I'll show you.

Brett

Small maybe it was just the angle.

Speaker 3

Angle of the.

Brett

Camera or something?

Cody

It's. A small.

Speaker 3

Looks great, by the way.

Cody

Say it again.

Speaker 3

The store looks great. The pitch.

Cody

Oh, thanks.

Speaker

And the books.

Brett

Beautifully merchandised and.

Cody

We worked all day. Yesterday, we moved everything around, changed all the shelves, took

all the products out that weren't selling. Rearrange stuff the I had the architects over and

they had the brilliant idea of putting light boxes. Into the store and putting them. Where one

of the shelves was to create a little moment of calm and peace and focus on the product.

Brett

Yeah.

Cody

And it just looks it looks awesome. It adds some light and brightness to the store, and

we've seen already more people walking in. I think those really where people were walking

up to the window looking inside and then walking out instead of coming into the store so.

Brett

You can see that where you've put it in this picture.

Cody

Yeah, yeah. Is it easy to send you a link or? Share a screen.

Brett

Whatever you want, man.

Speaker

Let's see. There.

Speaker 3

It is. Ohh I get it. It's a meditation chair. Oh, I've got it. So of course you're sitting on top of.

Cody

Yeah.

Speaker 3

That. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Cody

You don't sit on the bottom piece. You sit above the.

Speaker 3

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Cody

Shockingly. 2.

Brett

Shockingly comfortable, I have to get one of those for Ness. For sure. Yeah. So the idea is

not just for meditation and yoga. It's actually just sitting there while you watch TV or gaming

or talking on the phone.

Cody

They're great. Yeah, here's the guy talking on the. Phone I guess.

Speaker 3

Yeah, yeah.

Brett

Yeah, got it. Brilliant. And how much are they retail following?

Cody

350.

Brett

Oh my God, whoever's making those is making a fortune.

Cody

Yeah, we should start making them cause they're selling out and it's genius.

Brett

It's really genius. Alright. You're right. Have we solved 1 yet? How many have you got? You

got one.

Cody

We only have. One, but it's a drop ship program, so we basically get their information and

send it to them and they ship it and fulfill it and do. Everything.

Speaker 3

Move.

Brett

We'll send it to you. It'll be home by the time you get.

Cody

Type stuff. That's it. Yeah, yeah.

Brett

Perfect mate. Love it, alright. That's just, you know, it gives me great hope.

Speaker 3

Just those things alone, all right.

Cody

Yeah. So sent you to the. Agenda. As usual.

Speaker 3

Perfect.

Cody

Let's jump into it. So I just summary of those other changes. We got rid of the ice cream

freezer. I I think in retrospect it it just didn't fit at all. It makes so much more sense now

that's not in there.

Speaker

Yeah.

Cody

So I'll talk in a second about the action plan, but I think a lot. Of this move. And a lot of the

conversations we've had. With people over the last four or five days, I've really brought to

light. Yeah, we're definitely a gift store. We have too much happening. There's way too

much clutter in the store. If you don't know what you're looking for, it's hard to even figure

out a direction without a salesperson telling you. So I think part of our move is going to be

to declutter focus on the winners, take things down and be a little bit more premium space

things out a little bit and and just educate and tell a story with collateral and things inside

the store a little bit more on the money. So.

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Brett

Perfect. Agree, agree and agree strongly.

Cody

Yeah. Yeah. So met with the architects, talk about how we might do that because again.

We're open for business and it's going to be a mess if we just start. Messing with stuff

without a plan. So we'll talk about that in a second. Either way, finished last week with just

over 8K yesterday. My team member who was just awesome, called me so excited. I just
