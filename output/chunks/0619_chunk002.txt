without a plan. So we'll talk about that in a second. Either way, finished last week with just

over 8K yesterday. My team member who was just awesome, called me so excited. I just

did a $1200 purchase. They bought all half the CBD stuff again. I think it was. I think it was

another. I have 40 people in my office and I want to buy them all. Which I think is a really

interesting thing for us to look at. And then yeah, the the other update was.

Brett

Yes.

Cody

We did a couple, we did a giveaway with an influencer. Those little camuso necklaces. This

guys got 100,000 followers and just loves the store and basically said you don't have to pay

me anything. I'll just tell people that we'll give away. One of these things to someone who

follows your page and follows my page. And so we again doubled our following. We have

close to 700 followers now. It's just it's way better to do that than to pay for ads processing,

barely nothing. So which strategy?

Brett

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, great.

Cody

OK so. The action plan and we can get quickly into just questions I have. Yeah, I feel like. So

I I wanted to present you two options. One was a dark on the money, really focused on all

the mental disabilities. Where each Bay we have 8 bays in the store and I was going to

suggest each one would be a different thing. Anxiety, depression, feet, disorder, phobias.

PTSD. But it was just. It it just doesn't feel right to me and I know you. We we talked about

going further than what feels right, but it just feels dark and it feels like we don't have more

importantly enough products for each of those. Things yet to justify devoting a whole Bay to

it. So I really feel like anxiety, pain and sleep, at least for this 300 square foot school, are

the right things to focus on. And we make each wall one of those, and we very easily can do

that with a lot of the products that we have and we get a little bit more. So I wanted to talk

to you about that.

Brett

And I'm I'm totally with you.

Speaker 3

That your you thought deeply.

Brett

About this and that's that's that's the whole purpose. And what I've taken from what you

just said it is that it's not that if we had 2000 square feet to fill. If and when we get there.

Then it would be appropriate to have a sectioned off part of the still not.

Speaker 3

Sectioned off but we would.

Brett

We would delve into that and.

Speaker 3

You sort of move back to that degree of right. Yeah, so I I'm.

Brett

From my point. Of view. Support what you're saying and I support strongly many of the

things you've got down here, which is your 7-8 action points. Some some more than others,

absolutely. So let's let's really the point is, let's get into it and we'll learn. We'll learn

something again.

Cody

So on those action points, I really think we can go from 500 SKUs now to 50 to 100, which

sounds. Chaotic. Uh. But it it feels right and if you I sent you an attachment, did you see

that with a list of the brands?

Brett

I did? Yep, it doesn't. It doesn't make a lot of sense to me, but.

Cody

Yeah, I realized.

Brett

I got it. Yep. I get I get what you were talking about. The the red is.

Cody

The red is basically we'd we'd removed and I wanted to talk to you about. A couple of these

quickly just to get your take on it, so. The black stuff in here, the stuff that is not highlighted

red, I feel like is a really good fit. Still it sells really well. We should keep. Pretty much all of

those, with the exception of a few questions.

Speaker

Yeah.

Cody

Things like the hydro aromatherapy, those are our add-ons, which is why we sold 358. Of.

Them it's a shower, bath bomb, nearly a fit. On the money. But it's kind of a nice add-on. Do

we keep it versus just focusing on our add-on, which is good day chocolate which we sold

545 of. Astoundingly, and just just keep that that focus there. Because that one is on the

money.

Brett

Yeah. I think the one that's working that's on the money is a is a better choice that that's it.

Just makes sense if it's delivering to us as an add on. Which it sounds like it is, and it's

closer to what we think that makes sense.

Cody

Yeah. Hide the shower bombs are going to be way, way easier for us to make our own

version of versus the chocolates.

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Cody

So that's something to think about.

Brett

Well, in due course we'll get to making our own the, the and and concentrating on margin. I

mean, at this moment we're ignoring margin trying to find a the product that can. Yeah. So I

think the chocolate is the winner from that perspective.

Cody

OK. The other thing that's pretty important there is people are almost always buying the

shower burst as a gift for someone else, and almost always buying the chocolate as

something for themselves. So.

Brett

OK.

Cody

Good to know, John. So the mobot that's that water bottle foam roller.

Brett

Yeah.

Cody

Again, does it really fit? It's a bit of a stretch. It's been selling well enough 37 units to two

grand. It's a $50 price point. Do we keep it or is it? One of those things we roll out.
