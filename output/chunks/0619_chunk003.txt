Brett

Yeah.

Cody

Again, does it really fit? It's a bit of a stretch. It's been selling well enough 37 units to two

grand. It's a $50 price point. Do we keep it or is it? One of those things we roll out.

Brett

We will fix the car. It fits in because of the, you know, physical and mental Wellness, yoga

and and massage and.

Speaker

Yeah, so it.

Brett

It does fit. We're trying to be pure here. Rice does take up a lot of space. It's a it's a big unit.

So I think go with your gut. But when you merchandise this store, if you need to bring some

stuff back in, you'd obviously bring in those. The ones that. That's that's how I would think

about it. So rather than, you know, burn it or return it, yes. Or if you can return it, return it.

But you can bring it back again.

Cody

True lux and objects with purpose are two candles. Handles fit now. If we're going more

hard hitting.

Brett

I think to to me candles do because. If you think about. Relaxation. You know the whole

idea, if everybody in the world. Could who has has.

Speaker

This.

Brett

Could have a meditation room with their meditation chair and their little symbols and. And

candles and scents. That's all part of many people's ritual. I'll use a perfect personal

example here at Nest has, you know she's lucky enough she has a meditation room.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

And she's got all this, all that. **** in there and and me as a guy and that that doesn't. Have

any need or want to meditate? I just find it hilarious but. She likes. She does like the

candles and. He does all that to me outside of the scents and candles are a part of a. Part

of that. Mental health meditation. A lot of people are very much into. You know the.

Booting. For you to forget what they're even called, but you know. You hit them and the

and.

Cody

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Brett

And it's all about the vibration.

Speaker

That.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

You know they these are regular features on that on that type of stuff. So I I feel yes, that

they still have a place.

Cody

All right.

Brett

But maybe I would, honestly. Your decisions will be the right decisions and you can bring

them in, or you can put them in there and then you in in a. Week's time. Decide, yeah. You

know, the point is he we're making a big shift. We won't get it completely right, but let's get

it. Get it going.

Cody

Yeah. All right. I just want to get your opinion on a couple other categories. So tea, we have

a lot of tea in the. Again, it feels like it's a little off. Little off of the thing, but there are a

couple that are focused on sleep and a couple focus on stress. Maybe we keep those and

get rid of the. Other ones I think.

Brett

Anything that says stress on it. And.

Speaker

OK.

Brett

In Sleep has got to be at least a stand up start to consider. Because it's just tea for drinking.

Because I want to have a moment to relax and a nice cup of tea. That's that's it.

Cody

All right. And then there's these plants and this these coloring books, which again are

coloring books. Are. In my opinion, what I thought were beautiful. Beautifully packaged

coloring books. But they're not targeted to. Stress or anxiety relief. They're just coloring

books and placemats. Coloring placemats.

Speaker 3

Oh.

Cody

Though the kids like them, but they're just not related. You'd find them in a bunch of gift

stores or museum stores. So I might try to swap the brand out there and get more focused.

Yeah, yeah.

Brett

I think that they do have to have the because correct. Is this a kids coloring book? You

know, for art and craft? Or is this, you know, to take my focus my mind so. They are part of

the I'll give you again. This is a personal example of. Ah. I don't even know whether you.

Know this and forget whether this. Was before your time. But I. They had a tumor. On my

kidney, were you around then?

Cody

Yeah. When you went into surgery. Yeah. Yeah.

Brett

OK. So you were, so I had a tumour and the IT was it urgent and it was big and it was nasty

and. It gets identified. It was all one of those moments. Of course, I again was remarkably

calm about yes, it wasn't there three months ago. It's now this big, it's cancer. We've gotta

put you in the hospital and. Do it quickly. And. Ness through down. You know, because I

wasn't thinking about mess I. Was thinking about. Me.

Speaker

Mm-hmm.

Brett

So I I wake up as I go through this and this if they're talking. Doctors don't normally, but

they're talking cancer because it was so aggressively growing. I am not good. And then I

ended up in intensive care. It was like a six hour operation. I'm dramatising all this to make

the point and I'm in intensive care, unexpectedly end up in intensive care.

Cody

Oh.

Brett

And Nessus. Arrived just before I went in. And then something was supposed to be, you

know, two hours was. Ended up being 6 and and then I'm in intensive care which wasn't

supposed to be. And then then I'm out when I came. I was in and out in intensive care and

then when I fully sort of came good Ness is there sitting with me. Coloring in because.

Cody

In a coloring book.

Brett

Yeah, yeah, we should not. And that's what she was. Using to.

Speaker

Yeah.
