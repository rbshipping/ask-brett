then when I fully sort of came good Ness is there sitting with me. Coloring in because.

Cody

In a coloring book.

Brett

Yeah, yeah, we should not. And that's what she was. Using to.

Speaker

Yeah.

Brett

Help keep her mind. Off what looked you know, and that I'm oblivious to all this. But what

was a very stressful. Anxious time for her of not knowing anything and why. And you know

what? It's like in hospitals and. And then she sat with me. Brilliantly. Unbelievably so. It's a.

And I was. Pretty. Crook and it was all taught for a day or two, and she covered almost the

entire time, just as a way of and. I'm trying to, you know, throw a rat, go visit some friends

or something. Nourishing. You want to be there, but.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

Anyway, I'm telling that story of it because. It works for people, it works, so you know it is

part of, but it's not part of everybody's. That was what Ness was doing in that moment of,

you know, high high anxiety for for Nets anyway of. The the good news of the whole story is

that 10, which I've shared with you, it turned out to be. A very rare tumor that was non

cancerous. So it wasn't even that. I had cancer and they got rid of it. There was no cancer.

It was just the thing and it's all dealt with. But in that moment that Ness was in, that it was.

Speaker

And. You know it was.

Brett

It was all bad news. Yeah. Anyway, there's the answer to I think we've gotta have the right

colouring stuff because it seems to me that it works and it's, you know, therapists and

things that I've read about, you know, that's that's some things that they recommend for

anxiety.

Cody

Yeah, yeah.

Brett

And so on. Anyway, long story.

Cody

Can't wait for nest to visit the store? Sounds like our perfect customer.

Brett

Well, she is a perfect customer. She's a perfect retailer too, so she gets it from every angle.

Cody

Yeah. Alright, I'm, I'm clear on now and the rest of these. I think are very clear. Don't fit. Get

rid of. So my question for you is what the hell do we do with?

Speaker

Yes.

Cody

All of this product.

Brett

Yeah.

Cody

That we now have that either hasn't been selling or just doesn't fit anymore.

Brett

Yeah. So I mean, what, here's here's my merchant mentality coming in. It doesn't have to

be right. So we could just. Send it all back as best we can. Negotiate hard, not pay the bills

and say, well, look, I can't pay you, but I can. You can give. Me a credit. I'll I'll send it back to

you or give. Me half credit. And I'll send it back to you or something. That would be good.

The merchant in me says Mark it down to cost recovery fifth half price put signage on it.

Half Price section of the store whilst you're in the in the week or so that before you do this

shift over and get yourself organized. Just half price clear. There's two things right there into

when you do a half price you recognize sometimes that it's it's not the product that's the

problem, it's the price. That's a teaching moment because you go, oh, well, how come they

all sold out in three days when we put half price well. The product was appealing. Just the

price wasn't. And then other stuff you'll find well, it's not even the price, you know. Nobody

even wants it. I I can't give it away. So there's some learning in that it does clutter up the

store. You know, it's it turns the store into a bit of a mess, but you could sort of have one

one day. That was our clearance Bay. Then you don't have to worry about how you're

merchandising it so much. It's just half price in your face. Everybody loves a bargain.

Everybody loves half price, not 50% off, you know, half price. Everybody gets that, that's

that's worth looking at. And I would at least try that because then you're getting your money

back. So that's as good as sending. Back you're learning some stuff and then maybe at the

end of that sales period, you hang on to the stuff that's free, so that we you might want to

bring back in. And then we just deal with burn send back. Giveaway. Promotion. You know,

buy something here. Go pick something. From from there. And. There's multiple ways of.

That's that's how I would think about it because of sale and clearing duds. Dud sellers. Or

things we brought too much of or things. We shouldn't have bought. You know, is a natural

part of any merchandising retailing. So we just happen to have a lot of. Now you actually

don't have to. You can keep bringing it in mate so. You can take it away or. Or just put it in

all. The the shelves that you've got. There and and and keep refilling it. As as a help,

because sometimes it helps people come in. You know, there's nothing like a half price

sign to pull customers in, I mean. That it just works. So that's how I would think about that

and a bit a bit more work, but we'll get our cost recovery. That that would.

Cody

Help. OK, awesome. That all makes sense. Yep. Yep. Do that. I need to make a sign figure

out how. To.

Brett

Do that you would be. Able to order a hot. Made it you you would be.

Speaker

So.

Brett

Able to get sale signs and half price signs and red. Make sure they're red and white. Maybe
