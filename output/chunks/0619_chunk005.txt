out how. To.

Brett

Do that you would be. Able to order a hot. Made it you you would be.

Speaker

So.

Brett

Able to get sale signs and half price signs and red. Make sure they're red and white. Maybe

you you would you could order them online and they'll be delivered this afternoon, I

imagine. Or you could go to the local. Even a big home and not Home Depot. You know

staples, or what's the office? Staples. They would. The big ones would have this stuff.

Already provided cheaply, etcetera.

Cody

All right, so.

Speaker 3

That.

Brett

Would be the least of your challenges.

Cody

Yeah, yeah, I know. I know, I know. So effectively what I would do is go into our inventory

management system and just change the price of all that stuff to half off half off and it

would just reflect, OK.

Brett

Where you can put a sticker or a a sticker or A tag that says half price and then put a bigger

sign. For that section and you're done.

Cody

OK.

Brett

It's that simple.

Cody

Got it. All right. UM. OK, so back to the 8 steps. So we're clear on that, we'll. Get rid of

those. Try to reduce price. It cost back. The next is we have those hero display boxes. I I

think we can do some really interesting things by putting one or two of a product.

Speaker

Yeah.

Cody

And then teaching. People about it, which is a great little money. Instead of just filling them

to the brim, which is what we've. Done to date.

Speaker 3

Yes.

Cody

I want to turn around all the bottom shelves again, so it's solid wood. I need to figure out if

we can get a kick board or something on the bottom to prevent the scuffing that's

happening.

Brett

Yeah. So hey, buddy, I'm. If you need to talk through each one of these, I'm happy to do

that, but I have ticked all of these and tip and tick. Some of them, so I'm completely agree

and have got really nothing to add.

Cody

OK.

Speaker 3

So.

Cody

We can get to the questions my well. So the one key one that I wanted to discuss was the

decal in the window which which I think is probably the most important thing we can do,

get people in the store.

Speaker

Hi.

Brett

Yeah, yeah.

Cody

Uh. But I'm. I'm just. I don't know what I wanted to say. And I don't know how to make it

look so I'm wondering if we spend a couple 1000 bucks. Having someone design that and

making it look really beautiful and professional and. Getting it installed rather than me

trying to, you know, do keep mom calm and print it for 100 bucks at FedEx. I just I'm not

exactly sure again because if we're doing sleep, anxiety and pain. How do you say that?

How you draw people in? What's the right language there? I'm just a little confused, so I

wanted to talk to you about that. See if you had an intuition. Figure out how.

Brett

Yeah, yeah. And a bit like you. I'm a bit stuck between my. My all my experiences. We gotta

we gotta. Speak strongly and and it's a call to action that will grab people. And so I think.

Sleep. Two soft pane works and then I'm in my mind I'm going. Do you just put? Big. In your

face pain sleep. And is that all we need to say rather than trying to? Be creating around it

and something inside of me says we gotta try that. So when when I think about that? The

riding could be soft though. If you look at your T-shirts, right?

Cody

What do you think of this?

Brett

Well, I I think they're all. I think we they're great the black on the white works beautifully. It's

quite trendy. I just think. They need to be bigger, so pain should be. Just a bit like double

that. But I also almost take that what you put on your what you've got there and that could

be the decals.

Cody

OK. And just get those deep and put them up quickly and just see what happens.

Speaker

And.

Brett

It seems to me that that will give us, you know, sometimes it's about we can spend a lot of

time and a lot of money being perfect when when getting it going is the is the thing we're

not trying to be perfect. And. So I just love to almost, you know, pain anxiety can't sleep.

Cody

By the way, we can say insomnia, which is can't what you have when you can't sleep. It's

definitely. Yeah, more. Nasty. But if you thought sleep wasn't strong enough.

Brett

And.

Cody

I think we need to say sleep because that's.

Brett

What people? Yeah, I think we need to say sleep because in some he's just trying to be

something, you know, let's talk. We're we're we're trying to talk about people in the

language. They understand I'm in pain. Yeah. So to me, that's what it sort of feels like and.

That's how the I think that you could do that without too much trouble and get it going so

that it's not the signage doesn't come, you know, three weeks after the. Remodeled the

store and stuff like that. Now I don't want to over I I do have a tendency to say that, you

know, that's really easy. Get it done. But it's not really easy for you because you haven't

done it before. It's easy when you know people have got a whole machine that just turns

their **** out and you know. On a weekly basis. But. That's how I would say, so I would, you
