done it before. It's easy when you know people have got a whole machine that just turns

their **** out and you know. On a weekly basis. But. That's how I would say, so I would, you

know, just let's focus on pain there. Pain. It needs to be bigger on the T-shirt and then

bigger again for the decal that's they're sort of marry up.

Cody

Yeah. OK. And what about? I'm just thinking. I wonder if I can generate this real. Quick.

Instead of just three big words, you would do almost a pattern of sleep, pain, anxiety all

over the place in smaller letters to to just look a little bit more visually interesting.

Speaker

The.

Brett

The visually interesting is always nice. What we're trying to do is grab the attention of

people walking past and then. Pull them in. And so you're not looking to make something

visually. Oh, that's nice. You know, you're wanting to ohh bang. Now it always looks more

crass. Westfield will squeal to the heavens. Come on, but because they're trying to make

everything visually so. But we're trying to actually call to actions. So I would tend to overdo

the.

Speaker 3

The.

Brett

Hard hitting Ness of it as a more successful outcome, so that looks wonderful. It from a

pretty point of view from a creative point of view and is much more visually appealing,

appealing.

Cody

Yeah.

Speaker 3

But it doesn't.

Brett

It's it's confusing.

Cody

It's confusing. OK. All right.

Brett

Now inside the store you would.

Speaker

Do that.

Brett

You know, maybe you could unclutter it by just having the pain sleep and anxiety and take

the. Take some of that. The smaller ones out you see that big sleep, the big pain and the big

anxiety.

Cody

Yep.

Brett

You could. Did you just do that?

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

You are a genius buddy.

Cody

Yeah, this is pretty easy.

Brett

Yeah. Now, now you're just making fun of me.

Cody

There you go.

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Brett

And somehow you could play around with that so that it's. And the I really like the fact that

pain is there. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, don't, don't. Don't remember. People wanna

be able to read something without reading it. So that it just jumps in your head and that

doesn't. You see how that mentally does? As soon as you turn that paint the seat that. You

see how you can recognize that without.

Cody

Yeah.

Brett

Having to think about it. You might just make anxiety bigger and sleep, you know, but when

you're on the right. That's on the right track there. It it makes it more interesting stuff, you

know. Stuff like that.

Speaker

All right.

Cody

And just have this in one of the windows, or we'd put it in multiple windows, or where

would that? We have pain and one anxiety and another.

Speaker

Yeah.

Brett

That's why idea you check the words around so the. The the the main 1 is in. You could

certainly try that. So the two front windows are the most important, of course.

Speaker

Yeah.

Brett

And so paying features in that one side and the other side, maybe anxiety features and.

That's how you think about that. Now, even that font is a little bit fuzzy compared to the

font that's in the T-shirts. You see how the A it's a difficult A, it's a pretty a, but it's a

difficult.

Cody

Yeah, this is again, I just. This is some generator. I I'll do it in our font. That's much better.

Brett

Yeah. Yeah. So it's, you know, stuff that. Becomes all you gotta do is you're trying to get

somebody walking past who's not thinking about their pain, and then they see that pain

and the pain hits them, their connects a motion. I gotta go in there and figure that out. Drive

stuff.

Cody

These words actually work quite well together. I hadn't. I hadn't actually looked at them like

this, and I think they actually kind of make sense.

Brett

Yeah.

Cody

All right. So I'll play with that a little bit.

Brett

Yeah, see how you've made those the same colour change the colours so that. Otherwise,

sleep and anxiety get lost. You know, so make. You know, that's the. Sort of. All you gotta

do is think about not being pretty or being. You gotta go. I have to be effective here. I have

to read this. Somebody has to recognize this without. Being fully attentive to it.

Speaker 3

Yeah.

Brett

That's the trick.

Cody

You're saying make them different. Make them different colors.

Brett

Yeah, so that but the the main color you want is the main word. So what you're doing is.

Pain is gotta jump out and then sleep and anxiety is secondary. And then the other window.

Cody

OK. So you're saying for each window have like we just had one of them jump out with the

other secondary?

Brett

Yeah.

Speaker

OK.

Cody

Very helpful. Per window. OK, got it. All right, that was fun.

Brett

I was fun. That was bloody fast too. You. That was unbelievable. I can't. I can't tell you. How

can you tell you stories about me doing signage back in that, you know, 25 years ago that

what you just did there would have taken 3 weeks? We had to start like 5 months ahead of

time. Unbelievable. Wonderful.

Cody

OK.

Brett

Well, alright. The two ships are just they're great, the right colour tones.

Cody

So do I. We have seven team members. Do I buy three of them for everyone, one of each of

those for each person is, you know, what does that look like?

Brett

Yeah, maybe you don't find the cheapest black T-shirts you can, which are cheap. You get
