Cody

So do I. We have seven team members. Do I buy three of them for everyone, one of each of

those for each person is, you know, what does that look like?

Brett

Yeah, maybe you don't find the cheapest black T-shirts you can, which are cheap. You get

them printed. And that really the idea. Is you could get away. With two to start with.

Because they've got. To wear one, have one in the. Wash. The thing about black T-shirts

and all that they fade pretty quickly, but what we're looking for is the idea, you know that.

So try to. Yeah. You know the little whinge about it, you know? Ohh God, you're just. This is

your uniform. This is what you wear and you know. Some will want them tighter and some

want them looser and yeah.

Cody

Yeah. So I just basically get T-shirt sizes from everybody and order.

Speaker

Yeah.

Brett

And tell them because then I'll tell you what you know. Whether they because some girls

want tighter, some want lives.

Speaker 3

Away you go.

Cody

All right, so I'm clear there. Last couple of questions we just got this meditation chair.

Everyone wants to sit in it. I I think it is actually good theater to have people. When it's slow,

kind of sitting in this thing meditating the right way. But I wanted to ask you because most

most of this has been our policy.

Brett

It is a great a great question, and here's the problem the so the. The true pure answer is no,

unless they're demonstrating to to a customer. That the answer. The reason I say the pure

answer is no, because they'll sit in it pretending to that. And they're just slacking. Off and it

brings the energy of the store down. If you could trust them, which you can't terribly if you

were there, then you would sit in it right as part of you'd put it out. The you drag it out the

front of the. Store and you.

Speaker 3

Know you? Yeah, put.

Brett

That, as part of the theme. Yeah. So it's it's really hard now, maybe when you're there and

there's a quiet moment, you go sit there and meditate, but you really want to steer away

from that because it will bite you in. The ****.

Cody

Yeah, I almost rather. Yeah, I I agree with all that. I I almost rather have them sitting in this

chair than standing behind the POS, which is what they end up doing when it's slow despite

constantly telling them not to do that.

Speaker

Yeah.

Brett

As long as you've got the answer and then you may cause you, now you've become a

retailer. I mean, you understand why we can't have them standing around. You understand

the energy impact. You understand that they've gotta be busy. I am when we where I you

know if if I was in your your shoes I would. They can never stand behind the counter. Ever

write it down. They've either gotta be remerchandising, cleaning, dusting, moving there

never to be behind the counter. Even if they're pretending to clean because they've already

cleaned. Fulton. Well, now it's really difficult to do to get constantly happening, but you

just gotta keep working away. It do not stand at at the point of sale. And sales will go up

because of that, you know, time and time proven, proven, proven. Yeah. And the reason is

soon as they stand there at the end, then they the shoulders go down and they're staring

out into the they look dead anyway. You know, you know the answer me. So you you you

know the the cause what we're trying to achieve.

Cody

Yeah, it's all right. I'll. I'll play with that. It is eye-catching to see someone sitting in this

thing. So, yeah, I think, yeah, I'll, I have a solution for that. So we'll we'll fill that out.

Speaker

Is it? What?

Cody

All right. So the next thing. Uh. It's a bit embarrassing and I lost a lot of sleep over it. We got

our first bad review online and I wanted to share this with you.

Speaker

Yeah.

Cody

I was absolutely ******. And upset. You know, show this to you. I I wanted I didn't want to

send it over because I wanted to give you some context before the context was it was

Saturday. We had two team members on one of them took her lunch and within a couple

minutes the store got really busy.

Brett

Yeah.

Cody

And there were. Seven or eight people all needing things at once, and she was in the middle

of a $400.00 sale and was all excited about it. And this woman, I guess, who was just.

Upset about something came in and walked around and wasn't paid any attention to. She

was she was effectively ignored and she left the store and left a scathing review online

about our salesperson and about the store. And so here I'll share it with you. So you can

see it. Don't get upset. I've taken care of it. I've I'm working with her. To alleviate this, but

here you go. You need to read it out loud or do you want to read it?

Brett

Already I can see it clearly. Yeah.

Speaker 3

So.

Brett

What are you worried about it? So the what's the learnings? What are? You worried about?

Cody

Learning is it? Are we we need to engage with every single person that walks in the store.

We need to get better at working two or three sales at once instead of just focusing on the

one which I've said since the beginning. It was hard. It's it takes some training to do so. I
