00:00:27 Leah

Hello.

00:00:31 Brett

Where are you?

00:00:31 Brett

I don't know what I've done with you, Leah.

00:00:34 Brett

There you are.

00:00:35 Leah

How are you?

00:00:39 Brett

Well, it depends on what you tell me.

00:00:41 Brett

I'm hanging out with, like, a little kid with Christmas waiting for you to tell me about the product and everything.

00:00:51 Leah

Yes, right.

00:00:53 Leah

Okay, so...

00:00:54 Leah

Brilliant day yesterday.

00:00:58 Leah

We got some really, really great product.

00:01:00 Leah

We couldn't take any pictures, unfortunately.

00:01:02 Leah

We got absolutely annihilated for trying.

00:01:05 Leah

And because they're shipping it and it will be arriving on Monday, we'll just be able to take pictures when we arrange it and send it to you then.

00:01:14 Leah

But really, really good product.

00:01:16 Leah

We've got some mainly stainless steel, really good core.

00:01:20 Leah

Steph was able to identify, you know, what sells well in Lavissa and we purchased that.

00:01:27 Leah

And a few key fashion elements as well to kind of bring up the allure.

00:01:35 Leah

So really happy with that.

00:01:39 Leah

How many, Leah?

00:01:40 Speaker 3

How many?

00:01:42 Brett

Samples.

00:01:43 Leah

I want to say a good 300 maybe around that figure.

00:01:50 Brett

OK.

00:01:51 Leah

It was a good amount.

00:01:52 Leah

We spent about 10, about 10,000 EUR.

00:01:56 Leah

I know the joys of wholesale.

00:02:04 Brett

Jesus Christ.

00:02:06 Speaker 3

Yeah.

00:02:07 Brett

Steph would never have spent that much in her entire career.

00:02:15 Leah

Look, we want to give it the best chance, right?

00:02:18 Brett

Yeah, no, I'm with you.

00:02:19 Brett

It's cool.

00:02:20 Brett

The spend is not the priority at the moment.

00:02:25 Brett

I'm just, can't help myself.

00:02:28 Brett

Okay, so that's good.

00:02:29 Brett

So tell me, are you, have you got it envisaged in your head how it's going to get merchandised, how we're going to price it?

00:02:38 Leah

Yes, so

00:02:40 Leah

What we're going to do, we get, we receive the majority of it on Monday and then the remainder on Tuesday.

00:02:47 Leah

We're going to arrange it all out.

00:02:49 Leah

We're basically cutting out the size of the wall bays and the tables so that we can start merchandising it Monday, Tuesday.

00:02:59 Leah

Soon as the wall bay gets shipped and received in White City, Martin's going to get it up and then we can just start ranging and getting it up straight away in store.

00:03:09 Leah

Pricing wise, it's all from that kind of 25 pound mark up to, I would say, a maximum of around 50.

00:03:18 Leah

So we can see, you know, given that's where she's shopping at the moment, because the issue as well that I've just realized is we're in sale at the moment.

00:03:28 Leah

So we're going to have to move sale to like the other side of the store so we can give this a fair shot.

00:03:34 Brett

Yep.

00:03:35 Leah

And we can't, we need it to compete fairly with sale, otherwise we're not going to see an uptick.

00:03:40 Leah

So the product will reflect that.

00:03:46 Leah

So it'll be around that 25, 50, maybe even 60 pound mark.

00:03:50 Brett

Okay, now what about tagging and pricing at, you know, the practical elements of?

00:03:59 Leah

We've got a barcode printer in the office so we can get those printed and done.

00:04:04 Leah

Steph is getting the tags from real.

00:04:09 Leah

So that should be with us next week at some point.

00:04:13 Leah

We're just literally rebranding Livissa's tags with their using their diecast to speed it up.

00:04:20 Leah

So that should be with us.

00:04:21 Leah

So worst case scenario, we can get this, depending on labour on getting the war bay, the war bay receiving, the tags, we should be able to do it worst case the week after next.

00:04:32 Brett

What?

00:04:33 Brett

I'm coming next Wednesday.

00:04:36 Leah

I know.

00:04:37 Leah

Well, look, we can get as much in the store on the tables as we can until the war bay comes, but it just won't have the prongs or anything.

00:04:43 Brett

Well, where the hell is the war bay?

00:04:45 Brett

Where's the war bay?

00:04:47 Leah

On the way, and Martin's got to get it put up, nailed in.

00:04:52 Leah

But it's fine because we can get those T-bars and everything off of Amazon in the interim.

00:04:57 Leah

It's not, you know.

00:04:59 Brett

OK, so get all this done in, because we don't want to do this ********** but we need to do it quickly.

00:05:07 Leah

Yeah.

00:05:10 Leah

I'm my goal is to get that wall bay up and everything merchandise ready for you when you come.

00:05:16 Leah

on Wednesday, but you'll probably see it on Thursday.

00:05:20 Speaker 3

Right.

00:05:23 Brett

Because I can't come there following week because I'm in Australia.

00:05:29 Leah

Yeah.

00:05:30 Brett

And I'm away for about 3 weeks.

00:05:34 Leah

I know.

00:05:35 Leah

But video goes everything all day, every day, you'll get.

00:05:40 Leah

But I'm hoping it'll be done next week anyway.

00:05:42 Leah

It's just, it's just.

00:05:44 Leah

The delivery of stuff.

00:05:45 Leah

That's all it is.

00:05:47 Brett

Push, push, push.

00:05:48 Brett

All right.

00:05:50 Brett

So you're feeling good.

00:05:52 Brett

What was missing?

00:05:53 Brett

What don't you have?

00:05:54 Brett

Was everything there?

00:05:55 Brett

Were you overwhelmed with the choice?

00:06:01 Leah

It's.

00:06:02 Leah

I mean, look, it's the same product as what is in China, pretty much.

00:06:06 Leah

It's like all the on-trend stuff.

00:06:08 Leah

There's nothing missing, I would say.

00:06:11 Leah
