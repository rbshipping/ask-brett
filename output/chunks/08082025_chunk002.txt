00:05:54 Brett

Was everything there?

00:05:55 Brett

Were you overwhelmed with the choice?

00:06:01 Leah

It's.

00:06:02 Leah

I mean, look, it's the same product as what is in China, pretty much.

00:06:06 Leah

It's like all the on-trend stuff.

00:06:08 Leah

There's nothing missing, I would say.

00:06:11 Leah

We have a good range of core and a few sprinkling elements of fashion.

00:06:16 Leah

So I don't, in my view, see anything missing.

00:06:20 Leah

Obviously, because we purchase from about 6 stores, we can't like range it there and then because they wouldn't let us take the pictures.

00:06:26 Leah

We couldn't exactly estimate the mix, but we think we've got it right.

00:06:32 Leah

So, you know, I'm sure it'll be fine.

00:06:35 Brett

Did you visit that store?

00:06:38 Brett

Yeah.

00:06:40 Leah

It's quite minimalist.

00:06:43 Speaker 3

Yeah.

00:06:46 Leah

It's.

00:06:48 Leah

It's actually very, very...

00:06:49 Leah

Do they get from wholesale?

00:06:51 Leah

Because all the product that was in there, I saw pretty much in the wholesalers.

00:06:56 Brett

I don't know the answer to that.

00:07:00 Brett

I don't know.

00:07:00 Leah

It looks the same.

00:07:02 Brett

Yeah.

00:07:02 Leah

So we purchased a lot of the product that they have in there because we saw that store after the wholesalers and we were like, oh, we just bought that.

00:07:10 Leah

We just bought that.

00:07:11 Brett

Right.

00:07:11 Leah

I didn't see any personalization in there.

00:07:17 Speaker 3

Really.

00:07:18 Brett

Well, that's because the personalization is all under the counter.

00:07:22 Brett

You actually, they pull it out and say, that's not necessarily good.

00:07:32 Brett

I don't, that's just how they do it.

00:07:36 Brett

wasn't until I'd really gone through a sales process, I'm selecting this, it's for a gift, I want to do some engraving.

00:07:44 Brett

Then they went, okay, bang, here's the,

00:07:46 Brett

Here's the 28 to 30 selections of engraving things we can do.

00:07:52 Brett

And then they said, and we can add charms to it as well by, that's how come I know that they use the little clippers to.

00:08:03 Brett

Yeah.

00:08:04 Leah

Makes sense because there was someone stood at the counter talking to the sales rep and there was only one sales rep in there.

00:08:09 Leah

So she didn't pay us any mind.

00:08:11 Brett

Right.

00:08:13 Leah

But when and then they do, they have the silver this side, the gold this side.

00:08:16 Brett

Yeah.

00:08:18 Leah

But it's quite sparse.

00:08:19 Leah

It's not inundated with product.

00:08:21 Brett

No, it's not.

00:08:23 Brett

It's not.

00:08:24 Brett

OK, I'll have more.

00:08:25 Brett

I'm getting more and more data on that business.

00:08:28 Brett

So it's all for Intel.

00:08:29 Brett

It's not.

00:08:30 Brett

It's a bit like, you know, why is that working?

00:08:33 Brett

They are working and they are profitable and they are growing.

00:08:36 Leah

Yeah.

00:08:38 Brett

And just to, we're just trying to make sure we do the stuff.

00:08:44 Brett

All right.

00:08:46 Brett

That's good.

00:08:46 Brett

I'm so keen to see it.

00:08:49 Brett

The.

00:08:50 Leah

Pricing is the same as what our new one is.

00:08:53 Brett

Yeah.

00:08:54 Leah

Most of the stuff in the window was like 30 EUR.

00:08:57 Brett

Yeah.

00:08:58 Brett

Okay.

00:09:00 Brett

And I sent you over, sorry that I sent it with the wrong file.

00:09:06 Brett

I've just threw in a few comments, but it's brilliant.

00:09:10 Brett

Your presentation, Leah, is beyond brilliant.

00:09:15 Brett

I don't know.

00:09:16 Brett

Sometimes I go, how about how did you do that so quickly?

00:09:18 Brett

I don't even know when you had the chance to do that.

00:09:21 Leah

I was on the train.

00:09:22 Leah

I did it on the train last night, but the welding, I put that in there on purpose until I find another word for what this thing is.

00:09:32 Brett

Right.

00:09:33 Brett

This thing.

00:09:33 Leah

More of a placeholder.

00:09:35 Brett

OK, good.

00:09:36 Brett

Right.

00:09:38 Brett

So this thing, links, linking or look, I don't know.

00:09:42 Brett

It doesn't matter.

00:09:44 Brett

Just as long as you know what it is.

00:09:46 Brett

And so just add those things in there if you're happy with that or unless you want to debate anything with me.

00:09:54 Leah

No, all good.

00:09:57 Leah

Excellent.

00:10:01 Brett

And the reordering, here's the challenge on reordering, and it's a trap that will fall in.

00:10:11 Brett

Anything that is selling, we need to, as long as it's going to be a part of our future, then we should repeat, because you can't let good sellers

00:10:28 Brett

that customers want.

00:10:29 Brett

So you got to think the customers told us they want this and therefore we should order it.

00:10:36 Brett

Now I'm looking at this and going, we might be just a bit aggressive at the moment.

00:10:42 Brett

And then you've got to chunk out the things that, you know, Jules 2.0 will not be stocking because we don't want that.

00:10:52 Brett

And so I'm looking at it right now and they're all studs, right?

00:10:56 Leah

Yeah, they're like basics.

00:10:58 Leah

So I can see why they've sold.

00:11:01 Brett

Yeah, I can too.

00:11:02 Brett

It tells a story, right?

00:11:05 Leah

Yeah, it's just because we've got so many.

00:11:08 Leah

I'm just like.

00:11:10 Brett

Yeah, so but rule #1, when you're overstocked, the number one thing people do is go, oh, we can't afford to buy anymore.

00:11:21 Brett

So

00:11:23 Brett

Even the things that are good, they let run out and then you've just got more **** that customers don't want.

00:11:30 Brett

So it's a doom cycle.

00:11:32 Brett
