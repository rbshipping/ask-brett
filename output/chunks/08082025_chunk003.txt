00:11:21 Brett

So

00:11:23 Brett

Even the things that are good, they let run out and then you've just got more **** that customers don't want.

00:11:30 Brett

So it's a doom cycle.

00:11:32 Brett

So and because there's only 10 here and but the order quantities I'd like to see probably drop down.

00:11:49 Brett

So

00:11:50 Brett

That's a, there's a bit, it's a bit too much.

00:11:53 Brett

It's not that we shouldn't be ordering these because we're going to sell out, right?

00:11:57 Leah

Yeah.

00:11:58 Brett

They're just, it's too much.

00:12:00 Leah

Yeah.

00:12:04 Brett

One down here, you know, 300.

00:12:07 Brett

We're not selling.

00:12:08 Brett

And what is that?

00:12:16 Brett

The 18 gauge, whatever that is, down the bottom.

00:12:21 Brett

They don't have a picture.

00:12:22 Brett

I go, what the hell would we want?

00:12:26 Brett

Yeah.

00:12:27 Brett

Now we've ordered 240.

00:12:29 Brett

I know we sold 240.

00:12:33 Brett

And we've got 240.

00:12:35 Brett

It's just it's just too many.

00:12:36 Brett

Now, if I'm sure there's minimums on this, so that might be part of the problem.

00:12:42 Leah

I think 50 is the minimum.

00:12:43 Leah

I think 50 is the minimum.

00:12:44 Leah

So anything that's 100, we can move to 50.

00:12:47 Leah

LeBrett Bax, they might have a reasonable

00:12:51 Leah

We can move the 600, but I'll check because they might have, I don't know, there might be a valid reason why they want that.

00:12:58 Leah

So I'll check, but we can bring that down.

00:13:02 Brett

Now remember what I would want you to start doing, I didn't remember, this is command and control.

00:13:07 Brett

This is you signing off on this.

00:13:09 Brett

These are just Rebecca's giving you, here's what I think.

00:13:14 Brett

And you're the one that's got to make the final decision.

00:13:16 Brett

Now, it takes, I know it's going to take you a while to warm up to this, but it's not ask them why.

00:13:23 Brett

You've got to be able to go, that's stupid.

00:13:25 Brett

We don't need this many.

00:13:26 Brett

You've got to look at this and go, there's four weeks cover.

00:13:29 Brett

So the way you'll look at the first one up there, if you're looking at it, last week we sold nine, year to date is 28.

00:13:38 Brett

So that's like, well, that's not really a very big seller.

00:13:42 Brett

Average weekly sales are four, right?

00:13:46 Brett

Okay, four.

00:13:47 Brett

And so that's 100.

00:13:52 Brett

And then you know that we're likely to be getting out of two stores pretty quickly, both Brighton and Newcastle, right?

00:14:02 Brett

I mean, you have that information, right?

00:14:05 Brett

And so we got two stores less and four weeks, average of four, and we're ordering 100.

00:14:15 Brett

And I'm just doing all this fast.

00:14:17 Brett

I know you won't be keeping up, but this is what comes with experience.

00:14:22 Brett

I've got four I'm selling.

00:14:25 Brett

I've already got, where are we, 20 in the DC, 17, that's 37.

00:14:35 Brett

and now I want to order another 100.

00:14:37 Brett

Like, shoot me, right?

00:14:40 Brett

That's just, that's just shoot me.

00:14:43 Brett

Now, you're right to say we've got 37.

00:14:45 Brett

Well, that means we can carry on for at least another couple of months.

00:14:53 Brett

So you would quickly cross that out to 20, right?

00:14:57 Brett

You just take a red pen, 20.

00:15:00 Speaker 3

Yeah.

00:15:00 Brett

Because Beck doesn't know yet.

00:15:02 Brett

She's

00:15:03 Brett

She's not the leader.

00:15:05 Brett

She doesn't have the information.

00:15:06 Brett

She doesn't fully understand that we're shifting out of this.

00:15:11 Brett

They are steeped with the problem of we don't run out of product.

00:15:16 Brett

So that is 20.

00:15:17 Brett

So you work the next one down, the average weekly sales is 3.

00:15:22 Brett

You've got more or less the same amount of product and you just, you've kicked up

00:15:30 Brett

last week, which is nice, but it's the average weekly sales that is in there.

00:15:35 Brett

So, and then you, so it's like that's zero.

00:15:40 Speaker 3

Yeah.

00:15:42 Brett

So right, can you write this down right or can you do this on the screen?

00:15:46 Brett

Zero.

00:15:48 Speaker 3

Yeah.

00:15:48 Brett

Then you got the same thing more or less on #3.

00:15:54 Brett

So it's zero because you're not out of stock.

00:15:58 Speaker 3

Yeah.

00:15:59 Brett

Now that doesn't mean to say that you might not put an order in next week or the week after, because it might sell 7 again next week.

00:16:09 Brett

But the average is 4, three, fours.

00:16:12 Brett

Now you get down to the one there, it's six.

00:16:18 Brett

It's average is 6.

00:16:21 Brett

So you can, what number is that?

00:16:24 Brett

It's the ground stone, it's number is 439.

00:16:29 Brett

Yeah, Number 13 on the...

00:16:32 Leah

Yeah.

00:16:34 Brett

Now, I look at that and I go, well, the average is 6, but we're ordering, it's actually a better seller than the others, but it only sold four last week.

00:16:46 Brett

So that's what's throwing that out.

00:16:50 Brett

So Beck is not being quite efficient as she could be.

00:16:59 Brett

So you've got to cut this down.

00:17:02 Brett

So you would send it straight back to her and go, cut this back down by 1/4 and tell me the problems.

00:17:09 Brett

And we're not out of stock of anything yet.

00:17:14 Speaker 3

Yeah.

00:17:16 Brett

Now, we don't want to get out of stock because it takes time for this stuff to come.

00:17:20 Brett

But that's what you do.
