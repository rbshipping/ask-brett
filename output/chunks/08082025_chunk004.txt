00:17:09 Brett

And we're not out of stock of anything yet.

00:17:14 Speaker 3

Yeah.

00:17:16 Brett

Now, we don't want to get out of stock because it takes time for this stuff to come.

00:17:20 Brett

But that's what you do.

00:17:22 Brett

Now, what you want to see on this need for speed is this is where Monday, what are we doing?

00:17:27 Brett

They run through it.

00:17:28 Brett

And you can say, yeah, we need more of that, more of that.

00:17:31 Brett

She does it by Tuesday afternoon, you've signed off.

00:17:35 Brett

Bam.

00:17:37 Brett

Yeah.

00:17:37 Brett

It's not really critical at the moment because we're not doing enough.

00:17:40 Brett

But trust me, that's the way that we need to.

00:17:43 Brett

And it's ordered.

00:17:44 Brett

It's not like here we are Thursday, Friday, talking about it.

00:17:47 Brett

It'll be Monday before we...

00:17:49 Brett

That's just way too long.

00:17:51 Brett

But none of this is urgent, so it can wait, but it's too much.

00:17:57 Brett

So I agree with you.

00:17:58 Brett

said that, and you said I don't think we need any of it.

00:18:03 Brett

We probably need some of it because you don't want to run out of best sellers that are going to be ongoing.

00:18:10 Leah

Yeah.

00:18:12 Brett

And these all look pretty safe, right?

00:18:14 Leah

Yeah, they do.

00:18:17 Leah

Yeah, the only one is the pink one, number 12.

00:18:21 Brett

Number 12.

00:18:22 Brett

So you can make the decision right there.

00:18:24 Brett

We don't want any of that.

00:18:25 Brett

We'll be happy.

00:18:26 Brett

We've got 66 in stock.

00:18:28 Brett

We've got four as an average.

00:18:33 Brett

Just, whoa, just delete.

00:18:35 Brett

We're not going to, we're not going to replenish that.

00:18:38 Brett

You can make that decision.

00:18:40 Leah

Yeah.

00:18:41 Brett

And then the other, the product team and the head of product and Rebecca, merch planner, should both be allowed to have a comment.

00:18:55 Brett

No, we should, we should carry this ongoing.

00:18:58 Brett

And you go, well, it's pink.

00:19:00 Brett

Let's get another color or

00:19:05 Brett

The one below it, number 13, is blue, right?

00:19:09 Brett

And it has sold more.

00:19:13 Brett

So you're 100% right.

00:19:14 Leah

Yeah, it's clear.

00:19:17 Brett

It's got clear winner, which tells you, which makes sense, right?

00:19:22 Brett

Pink is, pink's a good seller, but people are looking for just ongoing colors, right?

00:19:32 Brett

So you're right to go, why wouldn't we just delete that?

00:19:36 Speaker 3

Okay.

00:19:37 Brett

That's the way the head of product has to be and you're the head of product.

00:19:40 Leah

Yeah.

00:19:42 Brett

And you got to switch your brain on to making the right decisions.

00:19:46 Brett

That's what this command and control is, right?

00:19:48 Brett

You're not telling them, you're going, like, we should delete that.

00:19:52 Brett

should not be an ongoing line.

00:19:54 Brett

What are we going to do to replace it?

00:19:56 Brett

Is there a better color?

00:19:57 Brett

What have we learned from that?

00:19:59 Brett

The crystal blue

00:20:02 Brett

It sells better than the than the pink.

00:20:05 Brett

So what does that mean?

00:20:06 Brett

Is there another is there another color that will be better than it?

00:20:09 Brett

Or yes, we will repeat the pink, but not for another four weeks until we get lower down.

00:20:20 Brett

And these things just fly off the top of your head after you get used to it.

00:20:25 Brett

Your job, Leah, is to be able to look at this.

00:20:28 Brett

and go, just look at all those numbers and go, okay, what does that mean?

00:20:32 Brett

We got this much in stock.

00:20:33 Brett

We've got four weeks.

00:20:35 Brett

Cover our minimum orders on this is whatever it is.

00:20:40 Brett

It takes 8 weeks, two or three weeks or four weeks to repeat this.

00:20:46 Brett

And you can just do all that in just got it comes.

00:20:50 Brett

It comes natural.

00:20:51 Speaker 3

Yeah.

00:20:52 Brett

It doesn't come natural in a week, but

00:20:55 Brett

Over a while, it just where you end up, you end up being someone where a new person comes in and you're looking at that and just going to do this, do that.

00:21:03 Brett

And they're sitting there in awe going, how do you know that?

00:21:05 Brett

How do you know that?

00:21:05 Brett

How do you know that?

00:21:06 Brett

You know, how do you, because I've just done it so many times.

00:21:10 Brett

It's pattern recognition.

00:21:12 Leah

Yeah.

00:21:14 Leah

Okay.

00:21:15 Leah

Got it.

00:21:16 Leah

Okay.

00:21:17 Leah

No props.

00:21:18 Brett

Because you have to have both brains.

00:21:19 Brett

You have to have a creative brain.

00:21:21 Speaker 3

Yeah.

00:21:22 Brett

And a functioning.

00:21:25 Brett

Mathematical, right?

00:21:27 Leah

Yeah.

00:21:28 Brett

You don't get the luxury of not doing that.

00:21:33 Brett

All right.

00:21:34 Brett

Is that enough for you or have I gone too fast?

00:21:36 Leah

Nope.

00:21:37 Leah

Perfect.

00:21:37 Leah

Got it.

00:21:39 Brett

Excellent.

00:21:40 Brett

And you lied to me.

00:21:41 Brett

You told me your kids were coming on Monday and they're not coming till the following Monday.

00:21:45 Leah

No, they're coming.

00:21:48 Leah

They're going flying up to Monaco on Friday, next Friday.

00:21:52 Brett

I thought it was this Friday.

00:21:53 Leah

Next Saturday, sorry.

00:21:55 Brett

Yeah, that's what I thought.

00:21:57 Brett

I was trying to plan with Ness and she said, no, Then she panicked that she'd got it wrong.

00:22:04 Leah

Yeah, no, next Saturday, the 7th, the 16th.

00:22:09 Brett

Right.

00:22:10 Brett

Okay.

00:22:13 Brett
