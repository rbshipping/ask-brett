Next Saturday, sorry.

00:21:55 Brett

Yeah, that's what I thought.

00:21:57 Brett

I was trying to plan with Ness and she said, no, Then she panicked that she'd got it wrong.

00:22:04 Leah

Yeah, no, next Saturday, the 7th, the 16th.

00:22:09 Brett

Right.

00:22:10 Brett

Okay.

00:22:13 Brett

That's all good.

00:22:15 Leah

I spoke to Kelly today.

00:22:20 Brett

Tell me.

00:22:21 Leah

Yeah, I mean, she's not happy.

00:22:23 Leah

I've told her she needs to cut minimum three people from the team.

00:22:29 Leah

I've given her, she was like, when do you need to know?

00:22:31 Leah

And I just said, I need to know by Monday.

00:22:33 Leah

So she's coming back to me on Monday.

00:22:37 Leah

I've given her my recommendations.

00:22:40 Leah

She can't have those conversations.

00:22:42 Leah

She's not, she can't fire people.

00:22:44 Leah

So I just said, I'll have those conversations.

00:22:46 Leah

You tell me who and I'll do the conversations.

00:22:50 Leah

She doesn't, she's not of the much, she doesn't understand it.

00:22:52 Leah

So I tried to break it down to her and I was like, look, if this was your money and your business and your hemorrhaging money, would you keep everyone in your team?

00:23:01 Leah

And she looked at it differently then.

00:23:04 Leah

She was, her biggest concern is she needs all this help to do everything.

00:23:10 Leah

And I just said, look, that's why we've got Steph.

00:23:11 Leah

Steph's coming over for a month.

00:23:14 Leah

She's going to be helping me mainly, but she's available to help you.

00:23:19 Leah

And I said, worst case scenario in the future, in the next couple of months, when Jules 2.0 gets nearer and you still need help, we've got Lavissa.

00:23:28 Leah

I'm sure Pierre and John would be more than happy to allocate someone to help with us.

00:23:33 Leah

And I said, but you know, you need to make that decision.

00:23:35 Leah

You need to tell me who and I'll do it next week.

00:23:39 Leah

So that's covered.

00:23:41 Brett

You're a champion.

00:23:42 Brett

We'll see how that goes.

00:23:44 Leah

Yes.

00:23:47 Leah

And I spoke to John and Pia this morning.

00:23:50 Brett

How are they?

00:23:52 Leah

Yeah, good.

00:23:52 Leah

Yeah, I think John's just like, he's super, I can tell he's really worried.

00:23:58 Leah

He's like, he's like, you know, what if, what if, what happens if, you know, because you're in sale and these two wall bays don't move the needle, is Brett just going to like throw the towel in?

00:24:10 Leah

And I was like, well, I was like, this is a test.

00:24:14 Leah

And he was like, what's going to happen with all the other product?

00:24:17 Leah

Are we going to order the product?

00:24:18 Leah

And I was like, we're going to continue as Jaws 2.0.

00:24:24 Leah

We need to continue the process.

00:24:26 Leah

We're ordering product.

00:24:28 Leah

Are we ordering for one store or just seven stores?

00:24:33 Leah

So, you know, he's just, I think he's just very, he's just like, I don't get it, but you know, it's fine.

00:24:41 Leah

He's on board.

00:24:43 Brett

While he's not necessarily on board, but communicate, I'm not communicating well enough with him.

00:24:48 Brett

So thank you for doing that.

00:24:54 Brett

And I've got to do a better job at that, of following through.

00:24:58 Brett

So I should have CC.

00:24:59 Brett

Did I CC my note to you, to him?

00:25:02 Leah

No.

00:25:04 Brett

I've got to start doing that.

00:25:05 Brett

I've got to start writing a few things after I finish with you and CC him to John.

00:25:11 Leah

He was just like, I'm worried.

00:25:13 Leah

I'm worried about you.

00:25:14 Leah

I don't want you to like, fail.

00:25:17 Leah

And I was like, we're fine.

00:25:19 Leah

Like me and Brett have got it.

00:25:20 Leah

Like, we're good.

00:25:22 Leah

We're clear.

00:25:24 Leah

So I think, you know.

00:25:27 Speaker 3

Yeah.

00:25:29 Brett

As long as PS stays positive, that's what's important.

00:25:34 Brett

And John's trying to stay on top of it, which is good, so that he can keep the

00:25:40 Brett

All the stuff that's supporting.

00:25:45 Leah

I also gave him the heads up that I spoke to you about the bailiff because he, I didn't want him thinking that I'm kind of like telling you stuff behind his back to get out.

00:25:57 Leah

Well, yeah, because of it's just us two, right?

00:25:59 Leah

So it's how we roll.

00:26:01 Leah

But I just wanted him to stay in the loop.

00:26:04 Leah

And he was like, oh, that makes sense because Brett emailed Chris, Chris Lauda.

00:26:09 Leah

And I was like, just letting you know.

00:26:11 Leah

I said, I know it's before your time, just letting you know.

00:26:15 Leah

So, I want to keep him on side.

00:26:19 Brett

No, that's good.

00:26:20 Brett

He's because he's in a position where none of that's his issue.

00:26:23 Brett

And we're discovering all these things.

00:26:27 Brett

He's all good for you because when you when we succeed, all these things happen, right?

00:26:33 Brett

And that's why you got to keep your antennas up and post your sentries.

00:26:37 Brett

And you're one of my sentries.

00:26:39 Brett

you're there guarding.

00:26:42 Brett

All right, that's excellent.

00:26:45 Brett

Well done on having that conversation with Kel.

00:26:47 Brett

There's no doubt that's a huge skill of yours and you just get into it, keep going.

00:26:54 Brett

We do need to make sure that we do this product properly so that we don't wonder whether or not, oh, it's polluted with all that.

00:27:04 Brett

other stuff.
