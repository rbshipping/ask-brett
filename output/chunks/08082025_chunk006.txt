We do need to make sure that we do this product properly so that we don't wonder whether or not, oh, it's polluted with all that.

00:27:04 Brett

other stuff.

00:27:05 Brett

That's going to be critical.

00:27:06 Brett

So even though I need you to rush and we need to do it quickly, we've got to do it right.

00:27:14 Leah

I know.

00:27:14 Leah

Because like the...

00:27:20 Leah

Because they said, are you going to get it online?

00:27:22 Leah

And I was like, we're not going to get it online very quickly.

00:27:25 Leah

We have to do photo shoots and everything.

00:27:27 Leah

He's like, so you're relying on people walking past the store.

00:27:29 Leah

And I was like, well, yeah, so we're going to have to change the window vinyls and promote that we've got stuff going in there.

00:27:34 Leah

But it's just one store, you know, and I said, we can do e-mail comms and social to invite people in to see it.

00:27:42 Leah

I mean, look, ultimately that, you know, there is a,

00:27:45 Leah

There is a risk that because we're in sale and it might not move enough of the needle, but we get the team pumped about it.

00:27:51 Leah

This is the new stuff in and talk to every customer about it.

00:27:56 Brett

Yeah, it won't be it won't be a problem because businesses quite often go on sale and still have their full price stuff selling.

00:28:06 Brett

And indeed, sale gets more people in.

00:28:09 Brett

So

00:28:10 Brett

Yeah, there's a pros and a cons to that.

00:28:12 Brett

I'm not worried about that.

00:28:13 Brett

What I'm worried about is us presenting the product in the way that we will so that it's it doesn't look be great or.

00:28:25 Leah

Yeah.

00:28:26 Brett

But you'll make sure that doesn't happen.

00:28:29 Leah

Yeah.

00:28:30 Leah

Yeah.

00:28:30 Brett

All right.

00:28:33 Brett

Anyway, I'll be there on Wednesday.

00:28:37 Leah

Great.

00:28:39 Leah

What do you want to do when you're here?

00:28:40 Leah

Because I hadn't planned for you coming.

00:28:42 Brett

Well, I want store design.

00:28:44 Brett

So same thing.

00:28:45 Leah

Yeah.

00:28:45 Brett

I want store design.

00:28:48 Brett

We have to nail that the next iteration.

00:28:54 Leah

Yeah.

00:28:55 Brett

And I desperately want to see the product and the pricing and the ticketing.

00:29:00 Brett

And, you know, maybe I'll just be there and I'll, I won't bug you the entire time.

00:29:05 Brett

I'll maybe I'll just.

00:29:08 Brett

Base myself out of my hotel room.

00:29:09 Brett

It's not ideal.

00:29:12 Leah

Well, you can come.

00:29:14 Leah

You can come.

00:29:15 Leah

You won't be bugging me.

00:29:17 Leah

You can help.

00:29:20 Brett

Yeah.

00:29:21 Brett

But we definitely want to get out there and see how we're.

00:29:25 Leah

Yeah.

00:29:25 Brett

I just want to make sure we're seeing how we set it up properly.

00:29:33 Brett

Because we've got to figure out what the look of the store is going to be, what the.

00:29:37 Brett

and what our product is actually going to be, what price it's going to be, and then we've got to get it going.

00:29:47 Brett

So for sure, it'll be a store visit on Thursday, right?

00:29:54 Brett

That's what you're saying, not Wednesday.

00:29:55 Brett

Yeah.

00:29:56 Leah

No, let's do it on Thursday.

00:29:58 Leah

Gives us a bit more time to just hopefully get everything in and, you know, the right.

00:30:03 Leah

Yeah.

00:30:04 Speaker 3

Yeah.

00:30:05 Brett

All right.

00:30:06 Brett

So design meeting for next iteration.

00:30:11 Leah

Yeah.

00:30:13 Brett

Because I think we've got to learn some things.

00:30:21 Leah

We can do, so we can do a store design meeting on Wednesday.

00:30:25 Leah

We can do the, you can see the ranging and the product on Wednesday.

00:30:29 Leah

So that will be Wednesday.

00:30:31 Leah

And then Thursday we can go to store and you can see us getting in there.

00:30:37 Brett

Yeah, we'll get it right and watch the customers.

00:30:41 Brett

I really want to be able to watch the interactions and what's going on.

00:30:47 Brett

All right.

00:30:49 Brett

dude, you're the best.

00:30:51 Brett

Get at it.

00:30:52 Brett

Have a nice weekend.

00:30:53 Brett

See you later.

00:30:54 Brett

Bye.

00:30:55 Leah

Bye.
