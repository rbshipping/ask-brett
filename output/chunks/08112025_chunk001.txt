00:01:30 Leah

Hi.

00:01:34 Leah

Hello.

00:01:34 Leah

You'll have to bear with me, so I'm sat in the car.

00:01:38 Leah

So if I look in the funny position, that is why.

00:01:43 Brett

What are you doing in the car?

00:01:45 Leah

Oh, oh God, my music's going on.

00:01:47 Leah

I have been here, there and everywhere today.

00:01:51 Leah

A bit of bad news, one of the team got ran over today outside the office.

00:01:58 Leah

I shouldn't laugh, I know.

00:02:01 Leah

She's fine.

00:02:02 Leah

She's alive.

00:02:04 Leah

But she got ran over.

00:02:08 Brett

You should potentially lead with she's fine, but she's fine.

00:02:16 Leah

She's fine, but she got ran over.

00:02:18 Leah

She's got fractured fractured arms and stuff like that.

00:02:21 Brett

Just to just to make me laugh, how do you get run over in that?

00:02:28 Brett

It's what happened.

00:02:31 Leah

She got run over.

00:02:32 Leah

She got run over outside the office.

00:02:35 Brett

What time?

00:02:36 Brett

How did this happen?

00:02:39 Leah

She heard this morning she was walking across a crossing and a car went past a red light and ran her over.

00:02:46 Brett

While she was on her way to work.

00:02:49 Leah

Yeah.

00:02:54 Brett

Jesus Christ.

00:02:56 Leah

She's right outside the office.

00:02:59 Brett

Didn't catch the guy is the guy.

00:03:03 Brett

It's.

00:03:04 Leah

Police is involved.

00:03:05 Leah

Everything's involved.

00:03:07 Leah

But the main thing is she's alive.

00:03:10 Leah

She'll be back.

00:03:11 Leah

She'll be back on Wednesday.

00:03:13 Leah

She's just got a few fractures.

00:03:22 Brett

Who was it?

00:03:23 Brett

Who was it?

00:03:26 Leah

Our marketing girl.

00:03:28 Brett

What's her name?

00:03:29 Brett

Do I know her?

00:03:31 Leah

Yeah, Katie.

00:03:36 Brett

Okay, so it wasn't her fault.

00:03:40 Leah

No, Car shot past a red light.

00:03:44 Brett

Good.

00:03:44 Leah

But I laugh because it's just bloody typical, isn't it?

00:03:48 Leah

It's just typical.

00:03:50 Brett

Yeah, the whole world's everything's against us.

00:03:53 Brett

All right, got that.

00:03:55 Brett

Okay.

00:03:58 Brett

tell her I don't know what to say.

00:04:04 Brett

Who cares?

00:04:05 Brett

All right.

00:04:07 Brett

Now, before I forget, just in your note to the board, there's one little change I think you should make from the

00:04:24 Brett

The one you sent me, I think this afternoon, I've looked at it.

00:04:27 Brett

Inclusion, inclusive.

00:04:30 Brett

Just crossed inclusive out.

00:04:33 Brett

Somewhere in there, there's inclusive.

00:04:36 Brett

Yeah.

00:04:37 Brett

We don't need to be politically correct.

00:04:44 Brett

This is a board document.

00:04:47 Brett

And what we need, if you could have another go at this, is just a little

00:04:53 Brett

High level, which I'm sure you'll put in your financial report somewhere that, you know, why are we still persisting is the answer that is the question we're going to get.

00:05:05 Brett

You've mucked this up.

00:05:07 Brett

Why do we think Mark 2 is going to resonate with the customer where what we did has been so dismal?

00:05:21 Leah

Yeah.

00:05:22 Brett

All right, perfect.

00:05:23 Brett

All right.

00:05:23 Brett

What have you done today?

00:05:27 Leah

Just quite a lot of meetings today, leadership meetings, talking about, went through that, the buy list.

00:05:36 Leah

Remember what we talked about on Friday with what they want to reorder.

00:05:42 Leah

So married that.

00:05:43 Leah

Yeah, good.

00:05:44 Leah

Narrowed it down quite a lot.

00:05:45 Leah

There's, I think there's six lines now that they want to reorder, all on the minimums.

00:05:51 Brett

We, instead of they, one of the ways to switch to you're in charge, we, one of the, what we want to do now is order six.

00:06:03 Leah

Yeah.

00:06:03 Brett

Because you're signing off, remember, these are, there's no order that gets placed unless you have said, I'm okay with that.

00:06:13 Leah

Yeah.

00:06:17 Leah

So that's good.

00:06:19 Leah

I can e-mail you the sheet if you want to see it.

00:06:23 Leah

But I know, like I don't think you need to.

00:06:28 Leah

So that's all good.

00:06:31 Brett

Just go.

00:06:34 Leah

Yeah, she's OK.

00:06:37 Leah

She seems OK.

00:06:39 Leah

She's asked to come back to me in the morning because she just wants to, she's basically spent a weekend sulking.

00:06:48 Leah

So when I spoke to her today, I was like, look, we've got our one to one.

00:06:52 Leah

All right, we've got one to one.

00:06:54 Leah

I do my one to ones on Tuesday.

00:06:55 Leah

And I said, we need to talk then.

00:06:58 Leah

I need the names or I'll pick for you.

00:07:00 Leah

And she was like, yeah, okay.

00:07:02 Leah

So, but otherwise, you know, fine.

00:07:06 Leah

Fine.

00:07:08 Brett

Sulking.

00:07:09 Leah

She is.

00:07:10 Leah

She is sulking.

00:07:11 Leah

She automatically asked if she needs to be one of the people to go.

00:07:17 Leah

That's her paranoia.

00:07:18 Leah

And I just said, look, no, I said, that's not what I'm suggesting.

00:07:21 Leah

Otherwise, our conversation would be very different.

00:07:24 Leah

But, you know, we do need to cut this product team in half.

00:07:29 Leah

So tomorrow morning, she'll be we have our

00:07:34 Leah

Because of all the palava happening this morning, we have our trade meeting first thing in the morning now, 8am in White City.

00:07:39 Leah

So after that, we'll have our one-to-ones.

00:07:41 Brett

Great.

00:07:42 Brett

How did that go?

00:07:43 Brett

What was the reaction to trade meeting all out there?

00:07:49 Leah

Yeah, fine.

00:07:51 Leah

Just actually really good to be in the store.

00:07:56 Leah
