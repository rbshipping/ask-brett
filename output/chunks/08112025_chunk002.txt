00:07:39 Leah

So after that, we'll have our one-to-ones.

00:07:41 Brett

Great.

00:07:42 Brett

How did that go?

00:07:43 Brett

What was the reaction to trade meeting all out there?

00:07:49 Leah

Yeah, fine.

00:07:51 Leah

Just actually really good to be in the store.

00:07:56 Leah

There's a lot of...

00:07:58 Leah

movement happening with like the charms now, snipping tags off and moving it around.

00:08:05 Leah

So getting some vinyls made-up for that, making that into more kind of like a gold, silver moment.

00:08:11 Leah

And then until we get the modular charm bay, we've figured out how we're going to actually achieve it on the actual bay for the short term measure.

00:08:20 Leah

So yeah, pretty good, pretty good, receptive.

00:08:25 Brett

Good.

00:08:26 Brett

And

00:08:27 Brett

Marching back.

00:08:29 Brett

I know he's back.

00:08:30 Leah

Yeah, he's back.

00:08:33 Brett

Is he good?

00:08:34 Brett

Is he?

00:08:35 Brett

Is he?

00:08:35 Leah

He's great.

00:08:37 Brett

Positive.

00:08:37 Brett

He's great.

00:08:38 Brett

He told him to change.

00:08:40 Leah

Yeah, he's loving it.

00:08:42 Leah

He's so on board.

00:08:43 Leah

He's just brilliant.

00:08:46 Leah

So he's all over the wall bay, he's taken delivery of it first thing Wednesday morning.

00:08:53 Leah

He's got people coming in to whack it up and do all of that.

00:08:59 Leah

Steph's all over the carding for the product.

00:09:02 Leah

So we should have carding this week.

00:09:06 Leah

Worst case scenario, we've ordered just plain carding for the earrings that we could just use that until the other stuff comes in.

00:09:14 Leah

So we should be able to get the product out and on the ball, on the wall tested for testing on Thursday, with Wednesday being the ranging day.

00:09:26 Leah

Product started to be delivered today from Paris and we're waiting for the rest tomorrow.

00:09:34 Brett

Love that.

00:09:35 Brett

Love that.

00:09:37 Brett

OK.

00:09:38 Leah

So Thursday, I'll be getting you to help Roy's leaves up and help us with the carding and putting all the products out.

00:09:47 Leah

Because I know you love all that.

00:09:52 Brett

I'll probably screw up more than I'll.

00:09:55 Brett

You know, there's a saying about you're either part of the solution or a part of the problem.

00:10:00 Brett

Like would well be part of the problem if you give me that.

00:10:04 Leah

Yeah, but you can be, you can just be given a second eye because Steph and I will be there and we'll be doing it.

00:10:11 Leah

I want to get it up.

00:10:12 Brett

No, that's the way to think about it.

00:10:14 Brett

Okay, excellent.

00:10:17 Brett

All right, what else do I need to know?

00:10:19 Brett

What's on your mind?

00:10:20 Brett

What's going on?

00:10:22 Leah

Nothing all good.

00:10:23 Leah

Everything is.

00:10:24 Brett

Can't say nothing all good.

00:10:26 Brett

This is stuff.

00:10:28 Brett

There's nothing never happens.

00:10:30 Brett

As you know, like somebody's.

00:10:32 Brett

gets hit by a car like from.

00:10:36 Leah

I know, no, it's all just kind of admin bits now, like, Martin's looking for a buyer for our welding machine, so tasked him with that, so he's doing that now.

00:10:48 Leah

The welding machine in White City will be fixed by the morning.

00:10:51 Leah

He's got someone coming out for us tonight for that.

00:10:54 Leah

I've asked him to take the screen out of Brighton.

00:11:00 Leah

because it's small like Reading and it's blocking it.

00:11:05 Leah

So I think we should have the screen from Reading in the mock shop and the other screen from Brighton in the office so the girls can be testing the screens before it rolls out.

00:11:16 Brett

Okay, yeah.

00:11:21 Leah

The retrofitting of the drawers is still in progress in Reading.

00:11:25 Leah

So Chloe at SDI should be back this week and it should be starting the wheels in motion on that.

00:11:33 Leah

This week, all of the VM kit and the packaging will be locationed and coded in the warehouse.

00:11:39 Leah

So that should be done by the end of this week, which is great.

00:11:44 Leah

And otherwise, we were just going through a critical path today.

00:11:49 Leah

i.e.

00:11:49 Leah

when product needs to be ordered for Jaws 2.0 and just making sure that they're on top of it.

00:11:55 Leah

The packaging mock-ups have gone into real, so we should have that being delivered to us the week after next so we can pick.

00:12:03 Leah

So what I'll do is I'll video it and I'll send you a picture of the three options for each tag we've got in each packaging.

00:12:11 Leah

And then we can agree on that.

00:12:15 Leah

I spoke to the tattoo guy today and told him we're not progressing forward.

00:12:20 Leah

So what I've asked Zoe to do is to get in and check all the expiry dates of the ink.

00:12:26 Leah

So we can figure out, you know, because there's a few things contractually that I need to just double check because we have signed.

00:12:34 Leah

I'm pretty much.

00:12:36 Leah

had an order sent to them for those 5,000 units by December.

00:12:40 Leah

So I'm just looking into that now as to how we just, I said to the tattoo guys, like, obviously we can't, we can't do that.

00:12:46 Leah

And he was like, yeah, okay, let's review it in three months with this next tattoo.

00:12:51 Leah

And I was like, yeah, we can review it, but I can't move forward with it.

00:12:55 Leah

So we just need to figure out what we need to do with the existing ink we've got that we've paid for.

00:13:02 Brett

Send it back.

00:13:04 Brett

Get a credit.
