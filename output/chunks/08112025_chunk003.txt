So we just need to figure out what we need to do with the existing ink we've got that we've paid for.

00:13:02 Brett

Send it back.

00:13:04 Brett

Get a credit.

00:13:05 Brett

Don't pay anything.

00:13:07 Leah

Yeah.

00:13:08 Brett

If we can't win on that because we've already paid it, send it back anyway.

00:13:13 Brett

So we get a credit.

00:13:15 Leah

Yeah.

00:13:15 Brett

And then we might, you might get lucky and get payment for it.

00:13:22 Brett

Because it doesn't work.

00:13:23 Brett

It doesn't work.

00:13:24 Brett

They sold us a dodgy product.

00:13:28 Leah

No.

00:13:30 Brett

Okay, good.

00:13:31 Brett

You're on that state path.

00:13:35 Leah

Booked in our next door design meeting for Wednesday morning.

00:13:39 Leah

So that'll be at 10am.

00:13:40 Leah

So what time do you arrive?

00:13:41 Leah

Do you come Tuesday night or are you coming Wednesday morning?

00:13:47 Brett

Tuesday night.

00:13:48 Brett

Yeah.

00:13:48 Brett

So I'll be I'll be good to go.

00:13:52 Brett

whatever time you say.

00:13:54 Leah

Great.

00:13:54 Leah

So the store design meeting is at 10.

00:13:57 Leah

So yeah, I'll get an agenda together for you and send it out to you tomorrow morning, first thing.

00:14:06 Brett

Excellent.

00:14:08 Brett

And I want to be a bit more, we want to think a little bit more deeply about the stores and

00:14:17 Brett

the way we might frame things.

00:14:19 Brett

That's the only thing I look at it, that sheet again, as I said that I would, and I've just feel we need a little more, we need to be a modern version of La Visa as opposed to a, yeah, I can see you shaking your head, so you already got that.

00:14:46 Brett

I just want to think about got to have wall bays, but they've got to be, they've got to be elevated.

00:14:55 Leah

For sure.

00:14:55 Leah

Like I think this is where the hybrid of the prong and the shelf comes in, because rather than it all just be prongs across.

00:15:08 Leah

that's where the propping on the shelves and then the actual prongs next to it will work.

00:15:12 Brett

I agree, but I'm wondering whether we need to insent and build out, maybe have a bit of a Victorian look by having, I don't know what I'm talking about, but Victorian meaning, you know, eaves like frame with those old-fashioned, not old-fashioned modern, but

00:15:36 Brett

What am I trying to frigging say?

00:15:38 Leah

You're talking about, you're talking about like the panelling, like the, you know, when you get in the houses and you've got the panelling around the walls, is that what you're talking about?

00:15:48 Brett

Around the ceiling, the ceiling.

00:15:50 Leah

Yeah.

00:15:51 Brett

Exactly.

00:15:52 Brett

Something like that.

00:15:52 Brett

But inset, build them out.

00:15:55 Brett

I just think that we need to be, but I don't mean prompts.

00:16:03 Brett

I'm with you.

00:16:03 Brett

We can't be all prompts because that'll be.

00:16:07 Leah

But we do need a good element of it.

00:16:10 Brett

Yeah.

00:16:10 Leah

To help with self-serve.

00:16:12 Brett

Yeah.

00:16:13 Leah

And especially as 50% of a product will probably be earrings.

00:16:24 Brett

Probably not.

00:16:25 Brett

Maybe not 50%.

00:16:26 Brett

I'm just thinking that might be a little too high, but yes, I get your point.

00:16:34 Brett

Okay, so I just need a bit more.

00:16:40 Brett

the element of what was that store you took me into in Westfield?

00:16:43 Brett

I've forgotten his name already.

00:16:45 Brett

The pink one.

00:16:47 Brett

Yeah, I don't mean.

00:16:51 Brett

I don't mean like that, but that there was incense and bought maybe a bit like the original, believe it or not, the original Diva.

00:17:01 Brett

God, I'm going back.

00:17:04 Brett

So that seems.

00:17:05 Brett

That seems.

00:17:10 Brett

Jesus, Vanessa might.

00:17:14 Brett

The original diva had, what the hell is that stuff called when you do the plastering?

00:17:21 Leah

I know exactly what you mean.

00:17:23 Leah

I can't remember the name of it, but I know what you mean.

00:17:27 Brett

Well, I should be able to search this up and show you imaging.

00:17:30 Brett

What do I call that?

00:17:34 Brett

If only I knew.

00:17:35 Brett

Doesn't matter.

00:17:35 Brett

Anyway, we'll do, we'll play around with this.

00:17:39 Brett

But that's just my reflection of thinking about it since I left you last week.

00:17:48 Leah

So, with this, so with this board meeting report, I noticed a minute ago you said in a financial report as well, what do you need to what do you need financially?

00:17:58 Leah

Because...

00:18:00 Brett

Well, this is where you've got to get...

00:18:06 Brett

What's his name?

00:18:08 Leah

Russell.

00:18:09 Brett

Russell.

00:18:11 Brett

But the job of a CEO is to put together a report that informs the board of loosely what the hell's going on.

00:18:21 Leah

Yeah.

00:18:22 Brett

And.

00:18:23 Leah

So I've got all that.

00:18:26 Brett

Yeah, you just have to go in a few pages.

00:18:30 Brett

Here's the problems, here's the challenges, here's what's keeping me up at night.

00:18:37 Brett

And so you think about it in terms of just the relationship.

00:18:41 Brett

You're trying to talk to a board that only meets every three months and they've got to read your report and be able to go, I know what's happening.

00:18:53 Brett

I know what we're doing.

00:18:55 Brett

I know what the results are.

00:18:57 Brett

I know where we're going.

00:19:00 Leah

Yeah, got it.

00:19:01 Leah

Okay, that's fine.

00:19:03 Brett

And it doesn't, it's not, it doesn't have to be laboured and fluffy and it's just, you'll never be fluffy.

00:19:11 Brett
