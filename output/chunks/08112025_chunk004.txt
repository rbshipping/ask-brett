00:18:55 Brett

I know what the results are.

00:18:57 Brett

I know where we're going.

00:19:00 Leah

Yeah, got it.

00:19:01 Leah

Okay, that's fine.

00:19:03 Brett

And it doesn't, it's not, it doesn't have to be laboured and fluffy and it's just, you'll never be fluffy.

00:19:11 Brett

But just, and really it's about, we're doing the decisions we've made.

00:19:18 Brett

Mark two, why?

00:19:21 Brett

It's pretty obvious.

00:19:23 Brett

We haven't resonated with the customer.

00:19:25 Brett

We haven't given up.

00:19:27 Brett

There's, there has to be,

00:19:32 Brett

another chain in the UK.

00:19:35 Brett

There's a gap in the market and this is where we, this is what we've learnt and here's what we're doing.

00:19:44 Brett

And that's just, I can do it all with them, but the high of the year is they've got to, the board has to read it beforehand so that they come into a meeting being aware of

00:19:58 Brett

And what they want to know is how much have we lost?

00:20:00 Brett

How much are we going to lose?

00:20:02 Brett

Why this comes into place?

00:20:05 Brett

Because they've got to sign off on.

00:20:08 Brett

Technically, they've got to sign off on.

00:20:10 Brett

So you're telling me you need another $5 million, Leah, 5 million pounds.

00:20:20 Brett

Now, Russell should be helping you with that.

00:20:26 Leah

So the only thing I don't know is just time frame.

00:20:29 Leah

So I don't know when your board meeting is, like what time, when you need this stuff by.

00:20:34 Leah

So should I ask Julia for it?

00:20:37 Brett

No, you should ask John when you speak to him, but I can tell you the board report was due yesterday.

00:20:46 Brett

Your report was due yesterday.

00:20:50 Leah

Okay.

00:20:51 Brett

The 10th.

00:20:53 Brett

And the full board report.

00:20:57 Brett

has got to be out by Wednesday this week, end of day Wednesday.

00:21:03 Brett

So that's the full board report to me and the rest of the board.

00:21:12 Brett

So I'm surprised that you haven't already been asked for us.

00:21:17 Leah

I've not had anything.

00:21:19 Leah

I've not had, John's not even told me about this board meeting.

00:21:22 Leah

The only reason I know about it is because of you.

00:21:25 Brett

Yeah.

00:21:26 Brett

Now, that's probably because they're all protecting you.

00:21:29 Brett

And I'm your co-CEO and I'm the big brother.

00:21:33 Brett

And this is but this is just good for you to think about what would I tell the board?

00:21:41 Brett

So that is absolutely due.

00:21:46 Brett

The Pentagon and triangle is absolutely due.

00:21:49 Brett

But don't panic.

00:21:55 Brett

Just, are you still speaking to John every day?

00:21:59 Leah

Not every day.

00:22:01 Brett

Okay, so get hold of Russell right now.

00:22:04 Brett

After you get off this call, go, Russell, Brett told me I was supposed to have a board report to you yesterday about what's going on.

00:22:14 Brett

Now, don't sweat it at all.

00:22:20 Brett

And you are going to have a session, remember?

00:22:22 Brett

You have a session that you haven't even been told about yet, right?

00:22:25 Brett

But I've told you.

00:22:26 Brett

Have I told you the date?

00:22:28 Speaker 3

No.

00:22:30 Brett

Jesus Christ.

00:22:31 Brett

Communication, Leah.

00:22:35 Brett

It's imperative.

00:22:37 Brett

I don't know what I don't know.

00:22:41 Brett

I will tell you the exact day you are on.

00:22:48 Brett

Where the hell is the board meeting?

00:22:52 Brett

Tuesday the 26th of this month.

00:22:58 Brett

And you're on at the end of the day, which is the start of your day.

00:23:02 Brett

So it will be approximately 7.30 or something in the morning AM for you.

00:23:10 Leah

Okay.

00:23:13 Brett

And you're on for half an hour.

00:23:15 Leah

I'll get the info from Russell.

00:23:17 Brett

And your job is to use that half hour to explain very simply what the hell you're up to and why you believe it's going to be successful.

00:23:35 Brett

And so you get hold of Russell and go, Russell, you're my CFO.

00:23:41 Brett

Get over here and we have an hour session on what the hell I got to tell the board.

00:23:48 Leah

Yeah, OK.

00:23:49 Brett

And he'll teach you a couple of things, hopefully.

00:23:53 Leah

Can I get something?

00:23:54 Leah

Can I get you the report then by the time I do it by tomorrow night?

00:23:57 Leah

Is that OK?

00:24:01 Brett

All I can tell you is that Chris gets fired.

00:24:05 Brett

Chris gets fired if he doesn't.

00:24:08 Brett

It's got to go to La Visa.

00:24:11 Brett

Then it comes to the directors, me, included.

00:24:14 Brett

And it has to be to me by, it's 5 o'clock the end of day, Australia, so it needs to be Thursday morning.

00:24:26 Brett

It's Thursday morning here.

00:24:30 Brett

Okay.

00:24:36 Brett

But don't, I don't want you to stress because you have an allocated time at the board meeting.

00:24:41 Brett

So you will be able to, but you should start at least partly preparing for that.

00:24:50 Leah

Yeah, that's fine.

00:24:51 Leah

I'll get it put together.

00:24:53 Brett

Yeah.

00:24:55 Leah

All right.

00:24:55 Leah

No worries.

00:24:57 Brett

But don't panic.

00:24:58 Brett

It's not, it's not critical.

00:25:01 Brett

It wouldn't be critical if you were.

00:25:03 Leah

No, I'm not panicking.

00:25:04 Leah

I'm just.

00:25:05 Brett

If you were Maria or Edward or John.

00:25:10 Brett

Yeah.

00:25:13 Brett

Because I forget about all these things.

00:25:14 Leah

Okay.

00:25:15 Brett
