00:05:39 Leah

Hi.

00:05:42 Brett

Where the hell are you?

00:05:44 Leah

I'm in Olay in White City.

00:05:45 Leah

Been in the store today.

00:05:53 Brett

Tell me, what's going on.

00:05:59 Leah

So we've been in store today, putting in the changes that we need to put in.

00:06:05 Leah

So rings are out now on trays.

00:06:08 Leah

It'll be interesting to see if we can get some momentum in those.

00:06:12 Leah

Moved, we've just basically implemented everything that we talked about in the trade meeting.

00:06:19 Leah

So we'll see what the impact is.

00:06:21 Leah

I've been in the store this afternoon with the team.

00:06:24 Leah

Zoe's been doing some school training with them.

00:06:27 Leah

So yeah, we should start seeing a bit more movement.

00:06:32 Leah

And we've just been prepping ready for the Rubei.

00:06:34 Leah

The Rubei fixture arrives tomorrow.

00:06:37 Leah

So Martin's taking that in tomorrow morning in White City and getting someone in to clinic it up.

00:06:48 Brett

So how did the meet forget all that you did?

00:06:52 Brett

How was that?

00:06:54 Brett

So it's the first time you've done it.

00:06:56 Brett

What are you going to do to improve?

00:06:58 Brett

How did it go?

00:06:59 Brett

Is it worthwhile?

00:07:02 Leah

It's definitely worthwhile doing it in the store and I'll continue doing it in the store moving forward.

00:07:07 Leah

Not going to lie, I was a little bit annoyed this morning because I told everyone to meet me back in the store for 8am and I went home last night.

00:07:22 Leah

I was in Reading yesterday.

00:07:23 Leah

I went home because obviously I'm not going to see the kids now for two weeks.

00:07:28 Leah

So I said everyone be in for 8am.

00:07:30 Leah

I left, I was on the road this morning, 3am in my car.

00:07:34 Leah

And I got to White City for 7:30, ready for our meeting.

00:07:40 Leah

Eight o'clock arrives, no one's there.

00:07:42 Leah

Well, Zoe turns up, Martin turns up.

00:07:45 Leah

Half 8, no one's there.

00:07:47 Leah

I'm like, this is a bit weird.

00:07:49 Leah

Reach out, 4:45, no one else walks up.

00:07:53 Leah

I'm just fuming at this point.

00:07:55 Leah

No apologies, no nothing.

00:07:58 Leah

So

00:08:01 Leah

I wasn't in the best mood, I'm not going to lie, this morning, because I was like, if I can get in the road at 3 o'clock in the morning and get there, you can get 10 minutes up the road to here to be on time.

00:08:12 Leah

And I just said to the team, I don't expect that again.

00:08:16 Leah

They wouldn't do it to you.

00:08:17 Leah

They shouldn't be doing it to me.

00:08:19 Leah

Shows a bit of lack of respect.

00:08:24 Brett

So there we go.

00:08:26 Brett

So is there

00:08:30 Brett

How did you deal with that?

00:08:31 Brett

Did you do it quietly, privately, or just let it rip?

00:08:38 Leah

No, I continued the meeting.

00:08:41 Leah

We started the meeting because I was conscious that the store teams were going to be coming in.

00:08:45 Leah

And I wanted to get done what I wanted to get done.

00:08:48 Leah

So we just continued the meeting as usual.

00:08:50 Leah

And then on my trade e-mail follow-up, after we implemented what we needed to implement, then everyone left and got back to doing what we needed to do for tomorrow.

00:09:00 Leah

I followed up on the e-mail and I just said, look, just a bit of an action and timings moving forward.

00:09:05 Leah

I expect a bit.

00:09:06 Leah

This is the standard.

00:09:07 Leah

This is what I expect.

00:09:09 Leah

Don't let it happen again.

00:09:10 Leah

I didn't want to bring it down while I was there.

00:09:16 Brett

Yeah, good.

00:09:17 Brett

No, you never want to remember criticizing private and praising public.

00:09:24 Brett

Just a general rule.

00:09:25 Brett

OK, so you're ****** *** that.

00:09:27 Brett

OK, you're right to be ****** ***.

00:09:29 Brett

So, is there a is there a sensible compromise?

00:09:33 Brett

Should you be starting at 8:30?

00:09:34 Brett

I mean...

00:09:35 Brett

I mean, it's how quickly you got through everything before the store got going.

00:09:41 Leah

We were still there when the store opened, doing the changes that we wanted to do.

00:09:47 Brett

Yeah.

00:09:47 Leah

And now I don't think we need to do it any later.

00:09:51 Brett

Okay.

00:09:53 Brett

So besides that ******* you off and that probably telling you something, they're just quietly protesting.

00:10:03 Brett

Right.

00:10:03 Brett

Testing you or something or ready to quit?

00:10:08 Leah

Well, they walked in with Kelly and Kelly's still got her nose put out the joint in the conversation with her on Friday.

00:10:18 Leah

That's probably what it is.

00:10:20 Leah

But on that, John rang me today.

00:10:23 Leah

I don't know what he said to you, but he's basically saying to me, and I

00:10:31 Leah

I've had my meeting with Russell today and I see it financially and even just like we need to get rid of it.

00:10:37 Leah

I need to go.

00:10:45 Leah

So I thought I'll wait.

00:10:47 Leah

So I've had my one to ones with Zary and Martin today and I was going to have a one to one with Kelly and Kate, but they were busy.

00:10:54 Leah

So I said, let's do our one to one on Friday.

00:10:57 Leah

So I wanted to have time to speak with you first, do what we needed to do and kind of make sure that is the right thing to do.

00:11:07 Leah

So, yeah.

00:11:09 Leah
