00:10:54 Leah

So I said, let's do our one to one on Friday.

00:10:57 Leah

So I wanted to have time to speak with you first, do what we needed to do and kind of make sure that is the right thing to do.

00:11:07 Leah

So, yeah.

00:11:09 Leah

OK, just to discuss tomorrow.

00:11:12 Brett

Gather this is a good experience.

00:11:17 Brett

John's got good experience, seems to have good instincts.

00:11:22 Brett

Sitting with Russell was valuable.

00:11:25 Leah

Yeah, really good, really good.

00:11:29 Leah

I understand everything.

00:11:31 Leah

I know where we're at financially.

00:11:34 Leah

Very much the consensus.

00:11:35 Leah

So obviously I've got to do this to John was like, I spoke to Brett, you only need to do a two pager.

00:11:41 Leah

I was like, okay, I'll double check for Brett.

00:11:43 Leah

But yeah, okay.

00:11:45 Leah

The consensus across Russell and John, they were saying, you know, leave the financial detail to us and just

00:11:54 Leah

say what else you need to say.

00:11:55 Leah

And I'll just basically my view on it is just sent you on the two pages.

00:12:01 Leah

This is what we spent.

00:12:03 Leah

This is what I'm planning on doing to cut costs while we're waiting for bills 2.0.

00:12:06 Leah

This is what we've learned, like what we've discussed.

00:12:10 Leah

So I'll get that done tonight and sent across to you.

00:12:13 Brett

Excellent.

00:12:15 Brett

Excellent.

00:12:16 Brett

That's great news now.

00:12:19 Brett

Leah, does that mean you should be having a one-on-one with Russell every couple of weeks?

00:12:25 Leah

Yeah, we put it in to have it every two weeks.

00:12:28 Brett

Good.

00:12:28 Brett

Excellent.

00:12:29 Brett

Because finance is part of the whole show.

00:12:34 Brett

And Russell's been skirting his responsibilities, which is a little annoying for me because he should have been more front and centre in the jewels.

00:12:49 Brett

just to be supportive and helpful and asking, how can I help on some of this?

00:12:56 Brett

And you can hand some of the financial stuff to him.

00:13:03 Brett

some of the stuff that's in there, we're producing the reports.

00:13:07 Brett

You can say, hey, I need this report.

00:13:11 Brett

Can you figure it out?

00:13:12 Brett

Either come through the visa,

00:13:15 Brett

It's a balance because you're a standalone and he's straddling across Lavisa and Jules, but it's good.

00:13:23 Brett

And he's not a bad bloke.

00:13:25 Brett

He's trying to be helpful.

00:13:28 Leah

Yeah, I mean, he explains things very clearly to be fair to him.

00:13:32 Leah

Everything that he sent to me and presented to me today makes total sense.

00:13:36 Leah

And I get it.

00:13:37 Leah

It's like, yeah, I understand exactly where we're at financially and what we're spending on everything.

00:13:42 Leah

So that's

00:13:43 Leah

a positive and I know what needs to happen to cut costs.

00:13:47 Leah

So I'll be just, I'm putting in, so I need to send you an agenda for the next couple of days.

00:13:54 Leah

Sorry, I've been in the store, so I haven't sent it yet, but I'll send it to you tonight.

00:13:57 Brett

That's all right.

00:13:59 Leah

And then, so if you come in for half nine tomorrow, we have a store design meeting plan and then not us planning to.

00:14:06 Brett

And not tomorrow.

00:14:09 Brett

The following day.

00:14:11 Brett

No, not tomorrow.

00:14:14 Leah

Find Julia put that you're coming tomorrow.

00:14:18 Leah

Sure, it's Wednesday, tomorrow.

00:14:19 Leah

She said Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

00:14:23 Brett

No, I'm so I'm I arrive in London tomorrow night.

00:14:28 Leah

Perfect.

00:14:29 Brett

Sorry.

00:14:30 Leah

That's fine.

00:14:30 Leah

Don't say don't say sorry.

00:14:32 Leah

No, that's good.

00:14:32 Leah

That's good because it gives me a little bit more time to get a handle on everything.

00:14:38 Brett

I think I might have changed that.

00:14:39 Brett

Yeah, good.

00:14:45 Leah

So my view is to have a chat with you after our school design meeting and talk to you about some of the costs that I was thinking of down as a co-CEO.

00:14:57 Leah

And that can then play a role in the board presentation month with what we're doing.

00:15:04 Brett

Yeah.

00:15:07 Brett

Good.

00:15:08 Brett

The whole point is we've got to have a focus on costs, but we're not obsessed by costs because we're we've got to get things right.

00:15:16 Brett

That's the.

00:15:17 Leah

Yes.

00:15:18 Leah

Yeah.

00:15:19 Brett

I mean, we have we have to do it right.

00:15:21 Brett

Yeah.

00:15:23 Leah

I mean, yeah, it's going to finish us.

00:15:31 Brett

Yeah.

00:15:32 Brett

OK.

00:15:32 Brett

The good news is.

00:15:34 Brett

There is some good news because you've got the mothership, Levisa.

00:15:36 Brett

It's had a very strong July, a very good July nonprofits.

00:15:42 Brett

So these things are relative, you know, to ease the pain.

00:15:49 Leah

I was having the conversation with Martin today and it's one to one and I was just, he was like, you know, is everything okay with my job?

00:15:57 Leah

And I was like, yeah, you know, like absolutely, he's great.

00:16:00 Leah

He's just roll his sleeves up, does everything.

00:16:03 Leah

And I just said, look, once we get past this hurdle, we get Jules 2.0 up and running.

00:16:09 Leah

My view is knowing how you've worked before is we get the concept working, we get the sales coming in, and then it would be a case of right now we need to make that money back and dilute those costs.

00:16:19 Leah

So it would be a bigger rollout.

00:16:22 Leah

Bigger rollout.

00:16:23 Brett

Bigger rollout.

00:16:24 Brett

Yeah.

00:16:25 Leah

He's ready for it.
