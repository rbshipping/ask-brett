hold you back

Do it poorly

Wrong thing Right thing

WHAT you do

Lessons

• Leading is more complicated than ever

• Change always takes more Wme & effort than we

anWcipate. . .and rarely sends us early signals of

success along the way (have to create them).

• Let’s admit it: we have to change ourselves if we

want to engineer change around us.

– Even means giving up some of what we are really good

at. . .and that is hard!

Given the challenges & obstacles, how do we lead?
