Dilemma Leaders Need to Navigate. . .

Not a Problem that Can Be Solved

The Experience of the Dilemma

• Never enough Wme

• Ongoing guilt

• Short-­‐order cook: constant shiVing from one urgent

need to another

• Focus on basic fears & anxieWes and their prevenWon

(miss the upside)

Why It Feels Rough:

Characteris7cs of High Achievers

• Intelligent

• Results-­‐oriented

• ImpaWent

• Successful

• Hungry for feedback

• Autonomous

• Want to be involved

• Overloaded agendas

Tool #1: Formulate a Guiding Agenda

Origins

Study of successful versus unsuccessful mayors

What

• A clear idea of your long-­‐term goals

• An understanding of what you must accomplish to get there

– Medium-­‐term goals

– Short-­‐term goals

Why

• A screen or filter to judge which acWviWes are most important

– which can be deferred and which do not maLer

• A means to make choices about how to spend your

Wme. . .and to hold yourself accountable

Bob Anderson’s Agenda

Long Term (18-­‐30 Months)

• Split telecommunicaWons from pharma

• Create untouchable space and Wme

Short Term (3-­‐6 Months)

• CompeWWve analysis

• Get John Burgess on board

• Create detailed 2 year business plan

• Do associate performance evaluaWons – make sure they get

coached

Medium Term (6-­‐18 Months)

• Have 3 VPs ready for partner

• Land 2 major accounts

Your Turn: Agenda Exercise

Step 1: Generate the long list

– OrganizaWonal = to advance the effecWveness and results of your

department or organizaWon

– Personal = to equip you to be more effecWve & saWsfied

Step 2: Analyze & reduce

– Look for goals that can be grouped together

– DisWnguish “need to accomplish” from “nice to accomplish”

Step 3: Create the short list

– No more than 10 total items

– No more than 4 per Wme period (short, medium, long)

Step 4: Share & revise

Short term = 3-­‐6 months

Medium term = 6-­‐18 months

Long term = 18-­‐30 months

Tool #2: Ask for Help (and Develop Others)

• For what percentage of problems & challenges that

you face, do you invite input, suggesWons, open

discussion BEFORE you have a soluWon in mind?

– What would your direct reports say the percentage is?

• What is the average percentage for your direct

reports?

– What would their direct reports say about them?

Tool #2: Pixar Thinking

Ask for Help (and Develop Others)

“What I realized. . .is, ‘Fine, I’m not an auteur. I need to write with other

people, I need people to work against. It’s not about self-­‐exploraWon—it’s not

about me—it’s about making the best movie possible.’ And as soon as I

admiLed that, it was amazing how the crew morale pivoted and suddenly

everyone had my back. If you own the fact that you don’t know what you’re

doing, then you’re s7ll taking charge, you’re sWll being a director…. I learned

that from John [Lasseter] on ‘Toy Story’—every Wme he got confessional and

said, ‘Guys, I think I’m just spinning my wheels,’ we’d rise up and solve the

problem for him.”
