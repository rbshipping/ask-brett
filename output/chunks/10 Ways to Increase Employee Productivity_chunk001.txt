TALES FRoM THE

FRONT LINES: SHADES OF

AL CAPONE OR Catt Him Up.

AND Fire Him AGAIN:

nce again, I am living out one of the retail

dramas I so often spoke about, theoretically,

during my consulting days.

It's the story of the top book who, aside

from the sales productivity, is the bane of your existence.

A real pain in the...neck. Not only does he (or she, but

indulge me) make you miserable, he has your whole staff

turned upside down and he’s walking all over them.

You're going through managers like Kleenex, and turning

over staff at warp speed. It’s a bad scene.

But what do you do? He’s your top book. Can you

get by without him? Can you stand to take the hit in

sales? Are you sure you're going to take a hit in sales,

or might you be releasing the rest of your staff from this

joker’s prison?

Here’s how I

nandled the situation in my store.

You may recall that I acquired staff when I assumed

ownership of my stores. So the first order of busin

was to find out what was really going on with the sta

uff,

I learned that, historically, every new manager seemed to

be beat into submission by Mr. Top Book within weeks.

So I knew I was not going to solve the problem with

a new manager.

had a new manager, and he was

le was making excuses for the guy

and adopting his perspective rather than a manager's

perspective and a company perspective.

The thought of letting this salesperson go was more

frightening than dealing with him. He was responsible

for one third of the store’s sales. He was among the top

five salespeople in the company. To the manager, the

pain of being the tough guy and confronting Mr. Top

Book and his questionable ways did not equal the

potential gain. So he joined him and was simultaneously

for lack of training. This was a well-

trained manager. But training does

not replace intent or resolve. Take Mr.

Top Book, for example. He’s been trained to play fair, but

he’s intent on following his own agenda. Does he win? He

does until someone enforces the rules.

I demoted that manager. He accepted the demotion,

humbly, and seemed almost relieved. I sent in the District

Manager to assess the situation objectively. He became the

store manager to complete the mission. If you've attended

our Multiple Store Supervision course (MSS), you'll recognize

this as camping out, something we recommend when there’s

a serious problem to be dealt with first hand, in person,

In this case, the indication for camping out was manager

and staff turnover, with the suspicious common element of

Mr. Top Book seeming to rule the roost through it all.

Well, the camp-out revealed that Mr. Top Book was

indeed causing problems, and not simply as a result of his

attitude. He felt that his high sales made him exempt from

all rules except those he made for himself.

In typical fashion, as discipline went in, his defiance and

non-compliance grew. Now, once you see this in full swing,

you just want to send the guy packing. But it’s extremely

important, both from a legal and an ethical standpoint, to

show your staff that no one gets terminated without just

cause, fair warning, meticulous documentation, and every

chance to improve.
