00:00:09 Brett

Hi.

00:00:10 Leah

Hello.

00:00:12 Brett

Why can't you see me?

00:00:14 Leah

I don't know.

00:00:16 Brett

Wait, There we go.

00:00:20 Leah

There he is.

00:00:21 Leah

How are you?

00:00:25 Brett

I'm terrific.

00:00:28 Leah

Good.

00:00:31 Brett

Yesterday, start with the...

00:00:32 Brett

Oh my God.

00:00:36 Brett

One.2.

00:00:37 Brett

What happened?

00:00:40 Leah

Yeah, what happened?

00:00:42 Leah

Quite end, apparently.

00:00:51 Brett

Anyway, we'll wait till Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

00:00:54 Leah

Yeah.

00:00:56 Leah

They're on at the moment.

00:00:58 Leah

What are they on?

00:00:59 Leah

They're on 900.

00:01:06 Brett

And what time are we?

00:01:07 Brett

Five, 5 o'clock.

00:01:08 Leah

Five.

00:01:10 Brett

Friday night.

00:01:12 Leah

Yeah, White City are on 1.7.

00:01:19 Leah

So now is their busy time.

00:01:21 Leah

So let's see what they can pull off in the next few hours.

00:01:25 Brett

Okay.

00:01:26 Brett

Well, listen, we, you and I have time together, so we don't have to have a long call.

00:01:34 Brett

Got any, got anything?

00:01:36 Brett

Update.

00:01:36 Brett

I didn't get anything from Marching.

00:01:39 Leah

You didn't.

00:01:40 Speaker 3

No.

00:01:41 Speaker 3

All right.

00:01:44 Leah

I'll chase him now.

00:01:48 Leah

No, just I've just been doing like catch ups and looking at store fulfillment and everything today.

00:01:54 Leah

I actually was sat and I was thinking about our conversation about Zoe last night.

00:02:02 Leah

And yeah, I don't know.

00:02:05 Leah

I think you're right.

00:02:09 Leah

I think you're right.

00:02:13 Brett

What caused you to...

00:02:16 Leah

She just takes every, it's just impossible to have a conversation with her without it being taken personally.

00:02:22 Leah

She takes everything so you can't hold her accountable without her getting upset.

00:02:28 Leah

And it's a difficult, it's a difficult one.

00:02:35 Leah

And so I said to her today, I was like, look, I can't keep having these conversations with you.

00:02:40 Leah

I have to have someone that I can talk to and hold accountable.

00:02:44 Leah

And anyway, it's just something I was just thinking about.

00:02:48 Leah

So look, we've got it until December regardless.

00:02:51 Leah

See how we go.

00:02:52 Leah

But it's just something I wanted to let you know that it is, I think you're probably, well, you're going to be right.

00:03:00 Brett

Yeah, I hate to.

00:03:02 Brett

I hate the fact that I might be right because she's quality.

00:03:11 Brett

She's a quality person.

00:03:13 Brett

I think that the big issue that she has, as many people do, is she doesn't want to fail.

00:03:19 Brett

When she fails, she takes it personally and attacks and gets the fancy.

00:03:27 Brett

But she's done the right thing.

00:03:32 Brett

Here's what I think is a thing that you probably should do.

00:03:36 Brett

You still need to sit down and go, what do I need?

00:03:40 Brett

And therefore you can get the, you can get the job descriptions of learning and development from, you know, the visa to cheat so that you can sort of

00:04:01 Brett

You just got to write up what you need and that will help you go, okay, which part of this?

00:04:07 Brett

Because the other thing is that for the size that we are at the moment, of course, we're willing to invest into the future, but we actually don't need the expense of, I mean, Zoe's, you know, experienced and so we

00:04:30 Brett

And the cost versus benefit is always, is always a business principle.

00:04:37 Brett

So if you write that up and go, what do I need?

00:04:40 Brett

And then go, why don't I have a look?

00:04:43 Brett

Because you've got two months.

00:04:45 Brett

Why don't I have a look?

00:04:47 Brett

Who, what can give us that?

00:04:52 Brett

Zoe does have an advantage.

00:04:53 Brett

She's lived through it.

00:04:55 Brett

She now knows what's required.

00:04:57 Brett

She's got the visa experience.

00:04:59 Brett

But if she hasn't got the drive, which she doesn't, she's already said, I don't want to do this anymore.

00:05:10 Brett

Now give her a just do that.

00:05:14 Brett

I mean, I think that would be worthwhile.

00:05:15 Brett

No rush on it.

00:05:16 Brett

But just done it.

00:05:17 Leah

I've got it ready.

00:05:18 Leah

I've got the job description.

00:05:22 Leah

So, I mean, ultimately, do we pay a L&D person 150 grand a year, though?

00:05:30 Leah

We don't.

00:05:31 Brett

No, we don't.

00:05:32 Leah

And that's what she's on.

00:05:33 Brett

Yeah, we wouldn't even pay half that, right?

00:05:36 Leah

That's what she's on.

00:05:38 Brett

Yeah.

00:05:39 Brett

And we can get a quality person for half that.

00:05:43 Brett

Yeah.

00:05:45 Brett

And that's a big consideration.

00:05:46 Brett

So you take that into effect, you know, that's.

00:05:51 Leah

On a positive note, Vanessa interviewed someone for me today and I interviewed someone for head of retail and Vanessa's very excited by them.

00:06:04 Leah

She said they're a gun, young, lots of experience.

00:06:09 Brett

Hell young.

00:06:10 Brett

Hell young.

00:06:11 Leah

Early 30s.

00:06:13 Brett

That's not young.

00:06:16 Leah

It bloody is Brett.

00:06:21 Leah

Well, look, she's not got any kids, no ties.

00:06:26 Leah

I mean, it's a risky age, though.

00:06:28 Brett

Very risky.

00:06:29 Brett

Very risky age.

00:06:31 Leah

I'm going to meet her in store.

00:06:32 Leah

I'm going to ask her while I'm off.

00:06:34 Leah

I'm going to say go into some stores, give me a plan, tell me what you change, what you do.

00:06:39 Leah

And then I'm going to meet her on Monday when I get back and see what I think.

00:06:45 Brett

Perfect, 3032.
