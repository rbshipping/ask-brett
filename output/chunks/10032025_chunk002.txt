00:06:34 Leah

I'm going to say go into some stores, give me a plan, tell me what you change, what you do.

00:06:39 Leah

And then I'm going to meet her on Monday when I get back and see what I think.

00:06:45 Brett

Perfect, 3032.

00:06:46 Brett

I'm only kidding.

00:06:47 Brett

32 is fine, but generally, because you only get two or three years out of somebody to run hard, hold people accountable.

00:06:59 Brett

So, and Ness is a pretty good, pretty good judge.

00:07:05 Leah

Yeah, she's got a good background.

00:07:07 Leah

She started as a

00:07:09 Leah

team member in ASOP and the founder found her and promoted her.

00:07:14 Leah

And then she opened a load of their stores and then she moved over to Skin Laundry and opened up all of their stores.

00:07:21 Leah

And yeah, and then we found, well, I found her CV and sent her to Nuts.

00:07:28 Leah

So.

00:07:30 Brett

And why does she want to leave?

00:07:31 Brett

Why is she?

00:07:32 Brett

Because you always got to ask the question because.

00:07:34 Leah

Stopped opening stores.

00:07:37 Leah

They're not opening stores anymore, Skin Laundry.

00:07:39 Brett

How many have they got?

00:07:43 Leah

I think Ness said she was running 26, 27.

00:07:48 Brett

You got to think, Ness knows this, but one of the important things when somebody's leaving a retail job, you go, why are they leaving it?

00:08:00 Brett

Because every retail company is always short on quality people.

00:08:09 Brett

And if you're quality, why would you leave something now?

00:08:13 Brett

If she's genuinely like it's not growing and I want to run 50 or 100, then she's your person.

00:08:18 Brett

So that's good.

00:08:20 Brett

All right.

00:08:20 Brett

That's great news.

00:08:22 Brett

That would be refreshing if you could find that when she's available.

00:08:25 Leah

She's immediately available.

00:08:28 Leah

She's got no notice.

00:08:30 Leah

There's something going on in skin, skin laundry where they're making a making redundancies or whatever.

00:08:34 Leah

So they've said that she can leave when she finds a job.

00:08:37 Brett

Right, okay.

00:08:38 Brett

There you go.

00:08:39 Brett

So you want to understand whether that's true.

00:08:42 Brett

Who are Skin Laundry?

00:08:46 Leah

They're a retail brand that sells skin care.

00:08:50 Brett

Right.

00:08:51 Leah

I've got to give, she's just sent me a couple of bullet points, so I'll call Ness after this and I'll just get a bit more of a rundown, but she's very excited.

00:09:01 Leah

I'll meet her, I'll see what she says.

00:09:03 Leah

We also spoke to someone at Monica Vinoda.

00:09:08 Leah

They've, they've stopped their roll out now.

00:09:12 Brett

I didn't know that.

00:09:13 Leah

They've stopped.

00:09:15 Brett

You're my, you're my TikTok newsreel.

00:09:20 Leah

They're not rolling out now.

00:09:21 Leah

They've spent too much money.

00:09:22 Leah

They're not rolling out.

00:09:23 Leah

They're not successful.

00:09:25 Leah

They're not making money.

00:09:27 Brett

How many they got now?

00:09:29 Leah

In the UK, I think they're on around 16, 17.

00:09:34 Leah

They've just, this beginning of the year, they open up Edinburgh and somewhere else, Glasgow.

00:09:40 Leah

But they're not opening anymore.

00:09:42 Brett

Well, the one, if Vanessa's excited by this girl and she's available immediately and she looks the part and she is actually, you know, genuinely being, you know, a gun, you know, she's your want.

00:09:56 Brett

She's your want for sure.

00:10:00 Leah

I'll get her to go into some stores while I'm off and see what she, I'll get her to do some work and see what she, I'll meet her and I'll see what I think.

00:10:08 Brett

That's a hard, it's a hard thing to do and you usually get gobbledy gate when that because you know she, you want to ask her not to focus on what would she do because,

00:10:23 Brett

You want to get it to only go to Westfield or Redding?

00:10:27 Leah

Yeah.

00:10:27 Brett

And you want to get it to assess the team.

00:10:31 Brett

Like, do a assess the team, issues, challenges, good things, and then any bad things, how would she address that?

00:10:43 Leah

Yeah.

00:10:46 Brett

See what happens.

00:10:47 Leah

Yeah.

00:10:48 Leah

Okay.

00:10:50 Leah

All righty.

00:10:52 Brett

Is that all we got?

00:10:54 Leah

Yeah.

00:10:54 Brett

Are you taking the week off or what are you doing?

00:10:57 Leah

I'm off.

00:10:57 Leah

Yeah.

00:10:57 Leah

Well, I'm not.

00:10:58 Leah

I'm working, but I'm away.

00:11:01 Brett

Now try to try to be away.

00:11:05 Brett

I know.

00:11:07 Brett

OK.

00:11:08 Brett

Talking to the brick, like talking to a brick wall, right?

00:11:12 Speaker 3

No, All right.

00:11:14 Leah

All be good.

00:11:15 Leah

All is ticking along.

00:11:16 Leah

Everyone's good to go and knows what they're doing for the next week.

00:11:21 Brett

I haven't got my, we were supposed to make decisions today, right?

00:11:27 Leah

Yeah.

00:11:31 Brett

That's what I was talking about in the car, right?

00:11:32 Brett

Because you were there when we both witnessed March and said, I'll have that to you tomorrow.

00:11:41 Leah

Yeah.

00:11:43 Brett

And here we are at 5:00 and you're going and I'm and I'm off and I'll get it sorted.

00:11:53 Leah

I'll call him now.

00:11:55 Brett

Anyway, see what you can do and then we can have a quick chat when I when I look at it.

00:11:59 Leah

Yeah, When are you away as well?

00:12:02 Brett

Yeah, I mean, I'm away again.

00:12:04 Brett
