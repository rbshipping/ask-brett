BBRC High Focus Topic – Succession Planning (evaluation)

Date: 			11th February 2015

What did you like best about today’s High Focus Topic session?

Hearing from others (Brett and other leaders)

Good not to have to spend money and time to get learnings like this

Topic was very well received

Generally the fact that it was an hour (“short and sharp”) – well received, we must stick to the hour, BUT conflicting feedback on this

What do you think could be improved?

Getting people discussing early/throughout x 3

Was too many people for all to share views in 1 hour

Ask BBRC Property when asking about numbers at the beginning of calls/sessions like this

Any other comments?

Follow up session in 12 months

Shane suggested trying to do a split Skype call so it’s on video – will need to look into this
