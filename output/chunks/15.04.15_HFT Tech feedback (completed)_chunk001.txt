BBRC High Focus Topic – Futurecasting (evaluation)

Date: 			15th April 2015

Presenter: 			Brett

Attendees: 			George, Eloise, Paul, Greg, Pete King, Darren, Gary

What did you like best about today’s High Focus Topic session?

Eloise: HB have now held a digital planning half day session on the back of this

Greg:  Sharing everyone’s answers was good, but we should do it earlier next time (Greg)

Pete King: “The best one so far”

Paul: “these sessions are good to bring to light stuff that would give us a step change.. Great interaction throughout the session”

What do you think could be improved?

Greg: “Way too short for such a significant discussion… too many unanswered questions left floating about”

Paul: “big chunk of topics discussed were well beyond / out of Lovisa realm. I think it would be helpful for us to take away and have our own session – which can come into play at upcoming workout”

Any other comments

Eloise: “Like the free and frank discussion. Plenty of warning for pre-reading and questions. Great follow-up. Nothing to improve”

Eloise:  “I will deliver RFID and counterless shops to you in no time. Got this” –

Pete King: Good pre-cursor to Tech academy
