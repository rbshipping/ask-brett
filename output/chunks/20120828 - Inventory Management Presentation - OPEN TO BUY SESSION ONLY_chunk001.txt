OTB

CFO

Merch gatekeeper of

Our

Planners CEOs inventory

management

buy

• Everyone is

involved in the

Our

Product OTB process

and has a

specific role to

play

• OTB is a blunt

instrument

126

Why the OTB process is so important

• OTB is a formal process to ensure we keep track of exactly what $

we should commit to inventory to support the expected customer

demand

• The process ensures communication between buyers, merchandise

planners as well as finance and the CEO to ensure we are being

financially prudent to meet our strategic and operational objectives

• The key control preventing us from being over or under stocked!

-Overstock will force us to markdown eroding $GM and profits!

-Over purchase does clog the OTB preventing fresh stock

-Over purchase can, in the extreme, send us broke

-Over purchase does disrupt good operations and effect morale

-Over purchase does effect our brand

-Over purchase does cause inefficiency and costs

-Understock will have negative impact on sales
