Online spending is dominated by those in their 30’s and 40’s, with the under 30’s recording the strongest growth

Most Australians say they prefer to buy online domestically and many have never transacted overseas

traditional retail

Multi-channel retailing is the way forward to satisfy consumer demand

Lack of online presence by large retailers has been a significant factor in the slow uptake of online shopping in Australia

The best retailers will be the ones that integrate their physical stores with online presence
