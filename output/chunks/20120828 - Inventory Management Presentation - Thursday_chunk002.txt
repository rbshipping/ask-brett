Why do we have Stocktakes ?

Allows for accurate replenishment and visibility on overstocks/understocks

Good corporate governance

Financial accuracy

Confirms the true dollar Gross Margin of the business

Stocktakes

[Slide 27]

Consequences of inaccurate stock holdings

Merchandise planning will allocate incorrect inventory

The store believes stock is available for sale (poor customer satisfaction)

Cash tied up through higher inventory levels

Lower GMROI

Excessive store labour - unproductive team unpacking inventory not required

Loss of margin due to markdowns

Increase costs (storage, freight, warehouse)

Loss of sales

More markdowns - less good product available to sell

Stocktakes

[Slide 28]

How we get inaccurate stock levels in stores or the DC

Moving inventory without recording

store transfers

samples taken

Bar codes not reading

Team not understanding that the Barcode is more than just the price

Scanning one item twice rather than each item separately

Not scanning returns

Incorrect stock sent to stores from DC

Negative balances being adjusted without proper checking

Too much inventory - misplaced sku’s (drawers/back rooms)

Stocktakes

[Slide 29]

Tips to a good stocktake

Ownership at all levels

Stocktake preparation is completed and store is ready

Team meeting is held prior to commencement of scanning

Adequately rostered

All receiving and transfers are up to date

Double count

Manual count of sku’s per “set” agreed to computer

No scanning till the store is closed

Everything is scanned

Backroom, drawers, bags received, counter

Someone is overseeing the process during the entire time

Store Manger to be accountable for results

Stocktakes

[Slide 30]

How to improve

Create awareness

KPI’s

Benchmark

stores

regions

DC audits – accuracy of picking

Absolute vs net differences

Stocktakes

[Slide 31]

Absolute vs Net variance

Net variance

A positive variance offsets a negative variance

Eg, one extra item counted at $7 will offset one item lost at $10

Net variance of $3

Absolute variance

A positive variance is added to a negative variance

Ignores positive or negative signs

The above example will have an Absolute variance of $17

Stocktakes

[Slide 32]

Measurement tools

Stock take variance reporting

Absolute results as a percentage of sales (units and dollars)

Retail shrink as a percentage of sales

Cost as a percentage of sales (for accounting purposes only)

Negative Stock On Hand

No. of POS overrides per store

IBT’s outstanding for more than 7 days per store

Overdue Purchase Order report

Measurement and Reporting

[Slide 33]

Tips and Traps

KPI’s to be monitored and actioned

Accountability

Proper training of team leading the stocktake

At least 8 months per year (up to Christmas set-up)

Rolling stocktakes creates rhythm

2 stock takes per annum (more if data integrity issues not resolved)

Accept delivery notes on day of delivery

Double count - manual count of SKUs per set agreed to computer

Stocktakes

[Slide 34]

Tips and Traps

All CFO’s, CEO’s, GM’s and Operational Teams must  attend stocktakes

Counting by range doesn’t work

Great in theory but not in practice

Insufficient focus during work hours

Stock in drawers and back-room

Don’t accept poor results

Find the cause of the issue and fix -it

If you manage shrink, it will reduce

Dynamic Pricing

[Slide 58]

Why dynamic pricing?

To minimise aged stock and maximise gross margin by being quicker at matching product price to customer demand

FACTS

We bring in 300 new sku’s every month and have to assign a price based on history, product cost and competitive landscape

The % of sku’s marked down from full price has been about 30% (Includes exiting residual stock on new sellers, exiting styles and marking down non performers)
