Dynamic Pricing

[Slide 58]

Why dynamic pricing?

To minimise aged stock and maximise gross margin by being quicker at matching product price to customer demand

FACTS

We bring in 300 new sku’s every month and have to assign a price based on history, product cost and competitive landscape

The % of sku’s marked down from full price has been about 30% (Includes exiting residual stock on new sellers, exiting styles and marking down non performers)

We are losing GM$ margin on being slow to match price to customer demand (bigger discounts required later/ opportunity cost of prong)

Our stock > 120 days gets as high as 55% of all stock

Key Elements

November ‘11: Introduced price prongs v’s priced cards

July ’12:

Introduced 7-14-21 stock management process utilizing the price prongs

[Slide 61]

No price shown on product card

Removable card

[Slide 62]

Price prong: Customer learnings

Customers can see the price without having to pick up the product.

Some customers still look to the back of the card for price

Some products get moved to different prongs and cause customer frustration.

Price scanners (3 store test) were not utilized by customers and complaints were minimal, suggesting that customers adapted OK.

Early on, it was difficult to see the prong pricing in amongst the product.

[Slide 63]

Price prong: Less wide ranges

Avg Range 65-75 prongs(January ’12)

Avg Range 45-55 prongs(July ’12)

Product covering price prongs

Price prongs clearly visible

[Slide 64]

Price Prong: Operational learning's

Easy to change prices quickly in store

Poor performing products are dealt with quickly, moving them on faster.

Needs constant attention to correct product location to avoid customer frustration at scanned price not matching prong price.

Sale set up is enormously enhanced by price prongs

Much easier set up v’s stickering

estimated labour saving at June’12 sale of $15-20k

[Slide 65]

Price Prong: Pricing up

A handful of sku’s increased in price since prongs introduced.

2 examples

Sku 709132: + $3, no loss in ROS, increase in GM of $1700

Sku 690386: + $5, no loss in ROS, increase in GM of $7000

Q: How do you sticker up?

[Slide 66]

7-14-21: A new mindset

Aggressive stock management

7 days: If not moving then reduce price on prong (30%)

14 days: Still not moving, increase price reduction (50%)

21 days: Customer still not interested, sold on run off gondola or marked down for future sale (up to 80% discount)

[Slide 67]

7-14-21: Impact

Learning:Not working hard enough on the “dogs”

[Slide 68]

7-14-21: Impact

Tested “Red price tags” for 50% price prong reductions

[Slide 69]

7-14-21: Impact

Needs further testing but results so far...

[Slide 70]

Dynamic pricing summary

Introduced price prongs to create greater pricing flexibility and margin optimisation.

Wrapped price prongs into a new aggressive stock control approach (7-14-21)

Early result encouraging... the concept is right... but still testing for optimal impact.

How exact metrics do we use to measure

What does good look like? (Broad guiding principles)

[Slide 73]

Metrics & Targets

Stock turns (COGS divided by MAT)

Absolute variance in stock (Retail as a %age of sales)

Forward weeks cover – whole business (DC & stores)

No. of POS overrides

Negative stock on hand

DIFOT (Delivery in-full on time) –suppliers to DC

Core item out of stocks by store

GMROI within the parameters overtime

Initial sell-through (50% in 6 weeks)

Aged inventory by store (monthly buckets

IBT’s overdue

OTB – against approved forecast and margin

Range versus clearance (mark down percentage – allowance. First margin / final margin is the only measure that counts)

Stock intensity

Overdue purchase order report

Refunds as a percentage of revenue (internal fraud)

DC picked accuracy report
