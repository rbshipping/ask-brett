Welcome

Thank you for being here

Thanks for the effort and commitment to doing the pre - reading

[Slide 4]

Why we are doing this two day conference

3

Page 61 covers it nicely

Weak area for all of us – our past is generally awful

Realisation that it was my issue

We are not realising our potential in inventory management

Opinion versus data – we get the fundamentals but it’s still very difficult

We must improve, in some cases change our ways

New skills required. Page 200 states it well

Inventory management is for reaching and has broad implications.  It has not been our ‘finest hour’, we must be honest on where we are and where we must be.

[Slide 5]

History

4

Background of music – all stock returnable

Very “gut” (opinion) based from the beginning

The shift from wholesale brands with low margin and high product cost, to high margin and low product cost – caused a lack of respect for inventory and our balance sheets

Quick to fault  IT systems and IT departments

In many ways to successful for our own good – never short on cash

[Slide 6]

The New Science of Retailing

5

Understanding analytical capabilities – all the way to the “new normal”

Gamma distribution

Cumulative probability

Opportunity cost

Average and standard deviation

The purpose of the pre- reading was to give a broad overview of how effective Inventory Management fits to achieve superior customer service, better business and better outcomes

I hope it was helpful to you

Now we have to deep dive…

Improve our skills and understanding to allow everybody to be able to do their roles successfully – understand our weaknesses

Determine

Guidelines for each brand

Hard stop rules and disciplines

Understanding  that “high tech” retailing is here to stay

Understanding and awareness of “the price” and consequence of getting Inventory Management wrong

Understanding “Opinion vs. data” – Science of retailing refers to it as ‘hunch-driven to data-driven’

The aim is to make us all smarter, whilst not lowering our creativity and product focus > page 7 sums it up
