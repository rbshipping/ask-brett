Region, State, Area, Store, Salesperson

When do we measure

Depends on supply chain demands

Often enough to ensure you avoid OOS and excess holdings

Steering Committee

&

Service Providers

[Slide 50]

Ensure you have a basic ROI metric to balance the Sales / Margin / Inventory relationship e.g GMROI.

Key Sales & Margin Reports should include Inventory and it should be measurable and transparent throughout the merchandise and location hierarchy.

Don’t talk about Sales and Margin without Inventory.

Measure and Report on aged inventory in the mix.

Measure first and final margins.

Inventory write-downs need to be captured in the category reports.

Invest in Information / Resource and Capability.

Where ever there is a Sales and Margin budget or KPI, add Inventory.

Can the stores make a difference, let them.

Have a cross functional team without the Silo’s (Accountability)

Create interest, competition and achievable goals of improvement.

Don’t just make it a project embed it culture.

Make it a cultural thing
