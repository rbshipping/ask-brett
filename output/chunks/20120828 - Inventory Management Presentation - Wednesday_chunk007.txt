Starting with the big picture: Which categories are trending up/down in the overall market?

Sales analytics

sample analyses, based on industry sales history for an apparel retailer

Key questions to answer: In which categories do you WANT to win, and in which can you CREDIBLY win?

Using this data, the retailer:

Mapped industry volatility to internal sales volatility

Reduced assortment of

Outerwear

Tailored clothing

Certain subcategories of intimate apparel

Bulked up assortment of

Swimwear

Certain subcategories of sleepwear

[Slide 101]

Moving to a macro internal view: Which categories are trending up/down within my assortment?

Sales analytics

sample analyses, based on internal sales history

Using this data, the retailer:

Delved into breadth vs. depth via customer research and

increased breadth of gold and fine jewellery (more SKUs)

increased depth of bridal

Segmented stores into different types and

reduced counter space allocated to silver jewellery in most stores (except heavy silver trading stores)

[Slide 102]

Category level sales analysis can help point where to invest and shift category focus (resulting in shelf allocation shifts)

Low selling

Low turns, poor GMROI

High risk of aged inventory that stuffs up the entire pipeline

Hopefully, via systematic reviews, you understand why some product is not moving

Assumes that any additional SKU follows a predictable pattern

Also need to look at:

Category growth

Target GM

etc.

The more fashion-oriented the category, the longer the tail tends to be

It's easy to think "These SKUs don't make me any money! I'm going to cut them from the assortment!"

[Slide 104]

But, before cutting tail products, it is critical to conduct customer basket analytics

An convenience store retailer deleted the bottom performing 20% of its SKUs to allow for expansion of its fast 'n fresh meal offerings – a critical part of their new overall strategy

Total sales declined 30%

While all of the deleted SKUs had low sales, when core customers didn't find them any longer, they stopped shopping this retailer

Issue with cutting the low-performers:

A cautionary tale

Key questions and example basket analytics

Are your best customers buying these products? (and how frequently?)

Are they complementary to another critical category that is doing well?

Does this product attract more shoppers to my store (e.g. The New Science of Retailing example of a grocery retailer offering a $264 bottle of wine to help sell the $67 bottle)?

Some retailers also look at customer purchase patterns to determine category strategy (requires sophisticated tracking)

example: Global fine jewellery retailer

Best practices

Know who your target customer is and is not your target customer

Track what your target customer buys from you

Relentlessly utilise purchase data to make assortment decisions

Bolster quantitative sales data with qualitative customer insights

Do NOT buy for people not in your target... you might hurt your brand equity with your target

[Slide 106]

Building the range plan is detail-oriented work, requiring serious trade-offs between depth and breadth in mix

Should I add another silver ring or gold?

Is it better to offer all size sheets in 400 thread count, or only certain sizes?

Would it be important for me to add Swarovski crystals to the range?

Attribute mapping can help decide which SKUs and weigh trade-offs between breadth vs. depth in a category (modeling)
