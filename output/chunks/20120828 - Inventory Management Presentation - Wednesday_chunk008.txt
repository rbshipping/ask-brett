Steps 1-3: Identify range of potential products for each category based on customer needs

Map functional attributes  to GBB/"triangle" strategy

potential specifications

No substitution between functional attributes

Important to identify potential for substitution among options

Modeling a critical prerequisite to estimation and optimisation, which New Science of Retailing covers in depth

Modeling a critical prerequisite for estimation & optimisation

Estimation

Steps 4-6: Mapping customer needs back to product plan

Build initial SKU plan

For each SKU, estimate demand for each based on sales of similar existing products (e.g. have at least 1 attribute in common with new product)

If a new product  is too similar to an old one, question need for it

Treat aSKU as a collection of attributes

Evaluate importance of each collection of attributes and estimate potential substitution between them

Build assortment plan

Number of SKUs constrained by category's available shelf space

Number of SKUs can be determined based on importance of attributes to the customer

Optimisation

Maximise revenue via shifts to the assortment

Calculate estimated substitution between SKUs to refine offering

Use the "greedy rule"  (a method to maximise revenue)

Build a localisation plan

Within a category, the size curve/intensity is a difficult area to get right, but can result in serious GM$ impact

Sales analytics

3

Best practices

Size curve should be based on sales history

Units purchased need to be evaluated against actual sales

It's important to use cluster analyses, so you can buy better by clusters (e.g. certain regions may have different size curves)

Make sure to map out of stocks when reading sales data – since you can't measure sales of items you did not stock

Note: Many assortment planning programs exist to help plan size curve

Example: Leading apparel retailer

Sales units, '000

Difficult to know true demand, but at $20 margin per pants, an additional 20k units in high demand sizes could have equaled $400k in GM$

Note: Could run a similar analysis for price points

[Slide 110]

Analysing competitor ranges in detail can provide eye-opening gaps in merchandise offerings and pricing strategy

Based on this analysis, Avenue shifted assortment focus to dress category (and away from underperforming knitwear) with a combined GM enhancement of >$12M

[Slide 111]

Localisation is another factor to consider in the planRequires detailed store clustering based on varied attributes

Customer trends

5

Potential clusters, not mutually exclusive, nor exhaustive!

Flagship/Power stores

Add more merchandise variety to top stores

Chanel only sends its fine jewellery collection to a handful of its flagship and best stores

Climate zones

Send different intensities of warm weather vs. cold weather  items to different store clusters

Avenue carries fewer outerwear options and creates more "alts" (short-sleeve versions of long sleeve tops) in its Southern stores

Size of store

Increase or reduce SKU variety and intensity based on store size (superstores vs. small-format stores)

Target Australia carries a much tighter range of merchandise in its "country" stores (about 40% of its network)

Demographics

Vary SKU variety within categories based on ethnic, income, age, etc. demographics of store location

Coles carries ethnic products in different concentrations across network

How localised should the assortment be?

[Slide 112]

Example: Macy's dept. store launched "My Macy's" to more systematically vary merchandise across its nearly 900 stores (I)

Downtown Brooklyn, NY

Herald Square, Manhattan, NY

37% white

32% black

20% hispanic

11% asian

33.3% HH have children under 18

median income/HH: $32,135

% pop in poverty: 25%

48% white

25% hispanic

13% black

11% asian

17% HH have children under 18

median income/HH: $47,030, but in some Manhattan zip codes it is >$90,000

Only several km apart, but completely different customers: The same assortment will NOT work!

Downtown Brooklyn store

Herald Square Manhattan store

Heavier concentration on every day wear

No dedicated formalwear (only seasonal)

No designer floor

Very small footwear section

No home wares section

Carries no luxury designers

Carries certain lines, like Sean John, in more depth (on a relative sq. meter basis)

While cosmetic section has similar sq. meters, fewer premium brands (La Mer, Chanel) on offer

Broad assortment

Several designer floors

Dedicated 'event' section

Special event shop-in-shops (e.g. a Christmas shop around December)

Has luxury brand concessions (such as LV) and designer collaborations (Karl Lagerfeld, Giambattista Valli)

Differentiated category approach

Differentiated brand strategy
