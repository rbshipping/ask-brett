Common assortment planning pitfalls

Forgoing in-depth bottom up trend analysis to complement top-down targets

Not planning well for OTB... or not staying within the plans

Buying for all customers, in lieu of a relentless focus on your core customer(s)

Trusting your "gut" because you've been right in the past

Treating all stores the same

And unforgivably: Collecting data, but not using it to impact assortment plans!

[Slide 116]

Zara: Best practice example

[Slide 117]

Zara is a wildly successful Fast Fashion retailer based on its strength in offering the right product at the right time

Consistent revenue growth

Strong customer loyalty

(customer interviews)

Source: Customer interviews conducted for a Zara competitor, 2011

"I tend to drop into Zara at least every week, because there's always a new shipment and my size sells out fast"

"I'm actually wearing my favorite Zara dress, and I always get compliments on it"

"They just have the best stuff, and if I'm not sure about something, I figure if they're carrying it, it must be hot"
