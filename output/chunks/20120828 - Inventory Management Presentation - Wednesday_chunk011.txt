[Presentation Topic: Inventory Management]

Not forecasting or inaccurately forecasting for unplanned product purchases (keeping some flexibility and $ in the back pocket)

Driving cash to hard

Not clearing “dogs” fast enough

Believing in miracles

[Slide 133]

Common (issues) affecting OTB forecasting Continued…

132

Delegation of OTB Planning to Merchandise Planning

Being too strict / Being too loose (near enough is good enough)

Unrealistic markdown forecasting

More than one OTB meeting per month.  You are overthinking the process

Weekly meetings should not have the word OTB mentioned

Forecasting to far ahead

Forecasting behind product planning

Building shortfalls in stock i.e. under stocked to quickly

Cutting OTB to aggressively and quickly to address over stocks

Ignoring overstocks……..some body must pay the piper

[Slide 134]

Does the work!

Provides input and recommendations

The CEO

Always wants more

Will be aware of and supportive of product initiatives, new directions and events

Helps decision making & problem solving

The CFO

Audits the disciplines, processes and accuracy

Needs to align cash-flow

Must not bet the farm

Tests assumptions and theories with the facts

Tempers enthusiasm

Keeps product discussion  out of the OTB

[Slide 136]

4 critical questions to ask yourself during an Open to Buy

135

Key things to look at in Open to Buy meetings

Do the sales and margin assumptions look right?

Do allocations to shrink and markdowns make sense?

Can we justify our closing stock targets relative to the forecast / actual

Do the ratios support our calculations?

OTB Tips & Tricks

136

One in one out – over the longer period

If you know what the closing stock target should be – the rest is “arithmetic”

To be done monthly (for the forecast period), not weekly

Don’t buy inventory just to achieve the stock target.

Accurate and agreed OTB is then handed to the product and merchandise teams, over seen by the CEO to slice and dice and allocate to core, trend, new, categories, repeat, promotional, basics, class, colour etc etc

……………..the fun begins

[Slide 138]

OTB Tips & Tricks cont…

137

Unit calculation is easier than $ but less accurate.  Don’t make big bets on stock if the trend does not support your stated belief

(if you are chasing increases, then increase stock at 10% of the increase ie if you are chasing a 10% above trend objective then 1% OTB above required for current trend)

Avoid confusing OTB meetings with Merchandise Planning or re-ordering/replenishment meetings

Keep it simple

Focus on trends/use graphs

Don't tolerate bad performance

Stop knee jerk reactions. make sustainable considered decisions

[Slide 143]

What is it really?

It is a process - not just a bunch of reports

Is not Shrinkage. Shrinkage is a lag indicator not a lead indicator.

Not just the fact that inventory is incorrect… Indication of overall management.

Needs to be integrated throughout the business. KPIs at various levels

Part of the Culture. Consequences?
