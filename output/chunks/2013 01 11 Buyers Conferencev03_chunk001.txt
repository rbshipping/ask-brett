Product that the customer wants

Our History

[Slide 9]

What is Fast Fashion

Our product evolution

Vertical retail brands vs. wholesale brands (speed and value)

The name on the door is on the product

We must be fast, not perfect

Only vertical will survive in specialty

8

[Slide 10]

What is Fast Fashion

Service and operational expertise has given way to product expertise

Our stores must be exciting for or customers – product is the main driver

What we do matters most - product is everything

Product is the big differentiator and the number 1 driver of our success

Remember our customer, always

Getting ahead of our customer:

Price

Product

Aspiration

Ignore your own likes, needs and wants

In the absence of being aware of this and managing, we will drift ahead of our customer

Hungary

19

[Slide 21]

We buy for our customer, we don’t sell to our customer

“We buy for the customer, we don't sell to the customer, I have learned that product developers, buyers and retail organisations, including ours, generally have trouble understanding this and I should repeat it again and again.”

20

[Slide 22]

Emotional Connection

Our customer does not need anything we sell

Fills the want and initiates an emotive reaction, we must have product that connects emotionally :

21

Love it

HATE it

Must have

To die for

“That's so beautiful”

[Slide 23]

Newness and innovation

Fashion is everything and everywhere, it has surrounded us

Reinvention is a constant, new, different, fresh and  first

22

[Slide 24]

Finding newness and innovation

Study your numbers- there are ‘gems’ in there

DCK

Discover why something worked/didn’t work - adapt

Talk to our team, customers, suppliers

“I am always looking”- online, magazines, competitors, local shopping centres, what are people wearing and doing

Fairs

Overseas travel

Immerse yourself in the ‘life’ of our category

Newness and Innovation also comes via new fabrication, materials and technology (cheaper, better, stronger etc)

Champagne and canapés – beer and pizza

23

[Slide 25]

Finding newness

Put your ideas into action immediately:

Sign off or approval immediately

Disregard your bad ideas quickly

If appropriate go to china to get stuff started.

Tip – keep in mind you should pay for your trip by at least 10 times through executed ideas.  If not, then do something different next time.

24

[Slide 26]

Newness and innovation

Planning for the next big thing:

Evolution

Revolution

Reinvention

When does a trend/fashion become the next norm?

We want to be there

Today’s fashion, tomorrow’s basics

Fad vs. long term big market e.g. wig, eye and face – indeed our very existence is this thinking, why we where created 10 years ago

25

[Slide 27]

New categories

Product extensions

Frocks - BNT

HB

Body suits

Ear piercing

Mood flame

26

[Slide 31]

Less is more

It’s too easy to fall into the trap of more and more product

Depth and width of ranging - we tend to go too wide and too deep

Less is more

One in, one out

Afraid to give something up

Hang on to the last

If we put in more options, we sell more

[Slide 32]

We work our store space hard

High stock intensity

‘Less is more’

How do these work together?

31

[Slide 33]

Doing more with what we have

Make big, bigger:

More colours

Sizes

Create category

See the gems that you can breathe life into – make small big

Examples:

Wash bag

Wigs

Swarovski crystal

32

[Slide 34]

When to let go?

Pearl Studs

[Slide 38]

Doing more with what we have

Launches – it’s important

Why

How

When

Retail team: our secret success for marketing and exciting our customers

If we are not ‘launching’ we are probably, at best, lacking innovation and excitement for our customers and team and at worst, not staying relevant

Your role in this

37

[Slide 39]

Testing

We never do enough testing

Time

Not pushing the boundaries

Lack of confidence

Testing is gold!

Testing lifts your success and sell through % and GM$

Always be testing:

Xmas

For trends

Adaptions

Colours

New ideas
