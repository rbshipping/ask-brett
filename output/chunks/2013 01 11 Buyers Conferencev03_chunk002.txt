[Slide 38]

Doing more with what we have

Launches – it’s important

Why

How

When

Retail team: our secret success for marketing and exciting our customers

If we are not ‘launching’ we are probably, at best, lacking innovation and excitement for our customers and team and at worst, not staying relevant

Your role in this

37

[Slide 39]

Testing

We never do enough testing

Time

Not pushing the boundaries

Lack of confidence

Testing is gold!

Testing lifts your success and sell through % and GM$

Always be testing:

Xmas

For trends

Adaptions

Colours

New ideas

Sub categories

Add ons

[Slide 40]

Gold vein

We must hit gold veins regularly

Above all else, our job is to keep creating product that fits the criteria of ‘must have’, emotive, on trend, innovative, new fresh and first! Add awareness and testing to this and a gold vein is coming

When we hit that gold we mine for all it's worth

Speed and urgency

We often miss gold veins that are staring us in the face

When something is selling well you are often very close to a gold vein

39

[Slide 41]

Gold vein

When you have hit a gold vein – get onto the next one

Failure will follow if you don’t get going again

Complacency

Living on yesterday’s success

40

[Slide 42]

Tips to keep in mind

[Slide 43]

Know your stuff

Know your business well, be on top of all aspects of your product role:

Be interested

Know what your product costs

Know the retail price

Know  the quantity you sell by week

Know what's on order and the quantity

These are all signs of your commitment and confidence in your role

42

[Slide 44]

Measure your performance

Measure your performance

Units sold

Sell trough %

First margin, final margin

If you don’t understand or are not getting this info, get it and understand it

[Slide 45]

Listening to our customers/team is risky

Not listening to our customers/team is even more risky

44

[Slide 46]

Margin management

It’s not the first margin that matters, it’s the final margin

There is no secret formula on margin policy

45

[Slide 47]

Pricing and margin management

Specialist vertical retail is about maximize your margin

Price driven retail is about cost plus fixed margin

We must know our customer, market and business

If we cannot make ‘the margin’ (at the right retail), then we cannot range the product!

But if the product is right we must range it! – we don’t meet min margin by putting the retail up.

[Slide 52]

Suppliers and price negotiation

They want to put their prices up, always

Prey on product creative people

Use every manner of justification

Any story that will run:

Wages

Tax

Socialisation

Cotton prices

Metal prices

New prices

New laws

Exchange rates

And they are convincing

51

[Slide 53]

Supplier and product negotiation

Know the retail price that you want before they give you the cost

The fist price is never the price

Changing, downgrading or re-’spec’ing is rarely the answer in a cost negotiation

Leave plenty of time for the Negotiation - saving face

Be ready and able to move on from a product (options and time)

MOQ if we cannot order the quantity we need,  then we cannot order

DCK takes the pain, time and cost from many of these issues

52

[Slide 54]

Suppliers: Tip 1

Plan to pay for your trip

Opportune buying

Overruns

Cancelled orders

[Slide 55]

Supplier: Tip 2

Find, visit and test new suppliers regularly

Test: never give an essential product or a big order to a new supplier - no matter what the issue, opportunity or incentive

[Slide 56]

Suppliers: Tip 3

24 hour response time

Ring or email when something is good (besides being motivational, it will make it easier when you call and need their help…  And they can help!)

Treat them as important , in your manner and attitude

Visit more often than you think you need to

[Slide 57]

Who Is Coaching?

[Slide 58]

Training, teaching

What happens if we don’t train?

Is this a shared responsibility

57

[Slide 59]

Etc, etc

[Slide 61]

Reminders

[Slide 62]

Open To Buy

61

Why we have Open to Buy

It tells us exactly how much we are allowed to spend on product each month

Is the key control to prevent us from being overstocked or understocked

It’s a blunt instrument that forces communication between buyers, merchandise planners, finance and the CEO

[Slide 63]

Open To Buy

What is your role (the buyer) in open to buy?

Make sure we are meeting customer demand

Make sure we have fresh stock coming in

Make sure there is a little buffer for when we find a gold-vein or a ‘must have’

Challenge the current trends or market shares of categories

62

[Slide 64]

What is Data Integrity?

63

Is about how accurately the product physically in our stores is reflected in our system

Physical quantity of items versus system quantity

Physical price of item versus system price

Getting data integrity right is critical to sales

Overstocks (mark downs)

Missed sales

Also important because future decisions / forecasts are based on historic sales data – if this data is wrong, we can end up making wrong decisions

Fraud

[Slide 65]

Data Integrity

What is your role (buyers) in data integrity

Make sure orders are accurately placed (quantity, cost price [freight, exchange rate, duties etc.] and retail price)

Minimise last minute updates (to prevent suppliers from making mistake)
