Range reviews

February 7, 2013

[Slide 2]

Product and range reviews

What we will cover in this session:

Purpose: Why run range reviews?

Frequency: How often should we run these?

Attendees: Who should attend?

Preparation: What do I need to do ahead of time? (where we will spend most of our discussion)

[Slide 3]

Range reviews: Purpose at a high level

Understand performance of your Buy

Find out what particular ranges and items did well/didn’t do well, and why

Determine if/how range should be repeated

Learn from each other’s range performance and document findings for future buying decisions

Make decisions on whether to shift spend on Buy to other categories

Help make smarter buying decisions for the future

1. Mark up 2. Mark down 3. Buy more 4. Buy less/exit5. Don't do anything

Not a presentation: Learning and decision-oriented

[Slide 4]

Range reviews: 3 different types

Systematic, thorough review of how the product ranges (the Buy) have performed

Generally, run in 3 different cycles:

Weekly (Mondays – I never met a retailer that did this on a different day!)

Check how ranges are performing, make decisions on repeats, DC stock, markdowns, and range rollout based on how performance is trending

Primarily focused  on GM$, SOH, and a read on new reactions. Best if conducted in the product room so team can point to products

Semi-regular (monthly or seasonal – generally 4-12 times per year)

Review total range performance relative to LY (GM$, turns, GMROI, sales vs. SOH)

Takeaway learnings on overall performance and what to do differently going forward

Semi-annual (generally 1-2X/year): Not all retailers do this systematically

Review performance of range over time to decide shifts in investment by category, product attributes, price architecture, and store grading

Our focus today, because this is where we have the most room for improvement!

[Slide 5]

Semi-regular range reviews: How often should we be running these?

No easy answer: It depends! And it may depend on whether the range is Core/Ongoing vs. Fashion

Typical frequency cycles that retailers use:

Seasonal (retailers that have seasonal cycles, e.g. 4 major drops per year, or long lead times often do formal range reviews based on these cycles)

Monthly  (generally used by retailers with a regular monthly drop of newness, or those going through a strategic shift)

Frequency set by sell-through targets (e.g. if a fast fashion retailer generally plans to sell 50% within 6 weeks, like diva, a review would be run at 6 weeks, before markdowns)

Frequency set planned by length of range (e.g. if a range is meant to live for 12 weeks, run the review towards the end of the life)

A few notes:

Not all categories need to be run at the same time, as long as regular reviews are set up

There is no one right answer – it depends on the category and the  organisation. What do you think is right for us?

[Slide 6]

Semi-regular range reviews: Attendees

Attendees:

Head of Buying

Buying team (how deep down depends on organisation structure/size)

Merch Planning

CEO

Head of Retail?

Practical tips for setting these up:

Time box each range/set a schedule in advance; first ranges reviewed tend to get inordinate amount of time

Nominate a “secretary” to take down key points/decisions to circulate after the range review; it can be a long session and it can be useful for recall

If org is big, do not bring whole Buying team; focus tends to get lost

Bring actual product to discuss – in fact, best if whole range is available for discussion

Core. Buying

Driven!

[Slide 7]

Semi-regular range reviews: 3 main levels of analyses to prepare beforehand

Performance analysis on overall assortment:

Performance of whole assortment, ranked by product category:

GMROI, sales to buy, GM%, and ASP this year vs. last year

Performance of whole assortment, ranked by range:

GMROI, sales to buy, GM%, and ASP this year vs. last year

3. 	Review of competitor assortment, promos, and marketing moves

Performance analysis at range level:

Overview by category within range

GMROI, sales to buy, GM%, ASP, and sell-through (TY vs. LY, if applicable, and vs. company average)

Performance on individual items within a range:

Best and worst performers – this is a tricky one!

Tail analysis

The focus of our discussion, since it’s where we have the most room to improve

[Slide 8]

Are you using these measures for category and range level analyses?

What does these analyses tell you? (Pantyhose example)

[Slide 9]

Why GMROI is important for assortment and range performance

What the heck is GMROI?

GMROI = Gross Margin in Monetary Units/Average Inventory Investment

To take a very simple example: An item with $10,000 of gross margin and $5,000 of average inventory would have a GMROI of 200% ($10,000 ÷ $5,000). The ratio may also be expressed as 2.0 or $2.00

GMROI tells you how many times you earned back from your original investment

Takes into account both GM$ as well as the cost of the inventory, so it is better than looking at only GM$

To increase GMROI, you have 2 levers: increase GM% or increase turnover

Over the planned lifecycle of the product/range, anything less than 1 is abysmal!

Is the higher the better when it comes to GMROI?

NOT ALWAYS!

[Slide 10]

Individual range tail analysis: A good way of looking at individual item performance in a range

What do these charts tell you?

Why run a tail analysis:

It will help you understand the individual SKU performance of a range and help you which products to exit and which to maximise

Tail analysis “how-to” Step 2: Map each SKU on a chart

The Y-axis is GM$ totals to 100%

The X-axis is each individual SKU

The top GM$ item brought in ~7% of the total GM$ for the range

The slope shows that the bottom 1/3 of SKUs only contributed ~15% of total GM$ to the range
