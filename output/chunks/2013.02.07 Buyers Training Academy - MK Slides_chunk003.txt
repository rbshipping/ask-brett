Low selling

Low turns, poor GMROI

High risk of aged inventory that stuffs up your OTB

Hopefully, via systematic reviews, you understand why some product is not moving

Assumes that any additional SKU follows a predictable pattern

Also need to look at:

Category growth

Target GM

The more fashion-oriented the category, the longer the tail tends to be… but some items might be important for brand image

[Slide 22]

Before cutting tail products, it is critical to think through potential customer reaction

An convenience store retailer deleted the bottom performing 20% of its SKUs to allow for expansion of its fast 'n fresh meal offerings – a critical part of their new overall strategy

Total sales declined 30%

While all of the deleted SKUs had low sales, when core customers couldn't find them, they decided to shop elsewhere

Issue with cutting the low-performers:

A cautionary tale

Key questions and example basket analytics

Are your best customers buying these products? (and how frequently?)

Are they complementary to another critical category that is doing well?

Does this product attract more shoppers to my store (e.g. The New Science of Retailing example of a grocery retailer offering a $264 bottle of wine to help sell the $67 bottle)?
