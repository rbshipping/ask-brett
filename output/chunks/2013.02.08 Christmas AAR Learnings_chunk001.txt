2012 Christmas AAR Learnings

BRAS N THINGS

The Good

Trial stores: everything tested one week prior (markdown format, windows, VM, team dress code) + great way to test sales & GM. Will do same for June Sale

Clearance Stores: Set up 3 stores and now will be ongoing. Important to ensure merchant mentality (sell from boxes: “Fish Heading”!)

Communication Hold: Everything through national retail manager only. Comms held for weekly memo. Comms held in World Manager.

Open Interviews: group interviews completed in 2 nights (rather than over 4 weeks); use of social media; format al documented to be used later

The Bad

Wage control: Overspent first two weeks and under spent last 3 weeks.

Next year will: roster only 1 week in advance; use last year figures day by day as a guide; force team to enter hours daily; focus on productivity during EOD calls

VM: We had 4 set ups in 6 weeks! As a result burned team out, dropped numbers, poor VM standards.

Next year will: have 2 stages only (15th Nov & 1st Dec); Use first late night trade to make change; improve VM guieds

Trading hours: Nowra Sanity cleared $1,000 before 9am!

Next year will: challenge all trading times (start and finish); Sunday 22nd open an hour earlier than trading times!

Product:  slipped in number of areas (incl. repeating last years, missing add-ons, no Christmas pack options)

Next year will: ensure Christmas product is not repeat from last year; add-ons under $10; pre-packaged Christmas offers

The Ugly

RD System change

Next year will: IT system changes must be launched Feb/March at LATEST! Need a co-pilot to manage flow and focused on that alone

Last minute ideas: Things we didn’t plan for we should have never done

Next year will: Not react to quickly – be planned; write it down and be better prepared for next year

LOVISA

The Good

Sale Packs: we have refined over the years instructions and expectations and have good rhythm to ‘flip the store’ even under Christmas Eve time pressure

Regional and State Roster: Started much earlier (mid November) in planning, mapping expectations all the way through mid January

The Bad

Engineered sale stock: thought we would use markdown stock but it was broken and less desireable

Next year will: Buy sale lines

Server capacity issues: slowing reporting dramatically and impacting decision making

Next year will: add to calendar to check in September (make sure sufficient capacity)

Careful with add-ons: Swarovski Studs add-on was raging success (20% sell through in week 1), but it cannibalised from store sales

Next year will: planning add-on will make sure fits guidelines of ‘add-on’ (i.e., won’t cannibalize store sales!)

The Ugly

Gift boxes: We thought they looked great – the customer didn’t get it (and one style fell apart)

Next year will: No gift boxes will go in at Christmas without physically selling units throughout the year

ADAIRS

The Good

Hamilton Island Competition: Big success driving sales and team behaviour.

Floating manager: in NSW and QLD helped a lot

Sale set up day: helped ensure well planned store execution

Christmas store product deliveries and set ups were the best we’ve had

The Bad

Vacancies: We had 4 manager position vacancies across the country the week before Christmas

Next year will: have a floating manager in each state and 2 in NSW & VIC as a development role and to step in for last minute vacancies

“Give time project” last week of Christmas, team to work minimum half a day in a VIC store to assist with unpacking boxes

Key Christmas products late: Including POS store Christmas elements. Christmas gift product still in the warehouse last week prior to Christmas or with Suppliers

Next year will: Find alternative transport providers to assist; Build in realistic time-frames to ensure stock arrives on correct day / time;

Incorrect pre-printed tickets and allocation – A3 tickets and sale tickets too late into stores for set ups

Next year will: store ops/merchandise team member to check ticket file and allocation before going to print

The Ugly

Star track Deliveries: From DC to stores (major issue in NSW)

Next year will: See above notes on alternative providers and building in better time frames

DC logistics and capacity:  Couldn’t handle peaking of stock impacted store replenishment

Next year will: See above better and clearer planning with buffer

Also continue Christmas product consolidation in China and having an additional day in between delivery and set up (big win); extend to gift and beach towles

DIVA

The Good

Early Actioning of Christmas Planners: Detailed Christmas planner developed and actioned starting August

Family and friends recruitment: hired total of 125 people

Proactive monitoring IT: to identify any stores offline and resolve issue asap

Christmas Novelty: best overall GMROI and successful execution: Next year there will be a team piece to wear or he Christmas spirit and we will implement novelty one week earlier

“Out of draw and onto the floor”: mantra and over-emphasis kept stock in drawers to a minimum

2 large launches: rather than lots of smaller launches over the period

½ Price gifts: Effectively a treasure hunt and opportunity to show a clear value message: we will definitely repeat the treasure hunt concept for Christmas next year

The Bad & Ugly

Manual recruitment processing: application forms and starter packs not elecrtonic

Next year will: All Christmas team members to have electronic forms

Not having enough backup equipment: Eftpos, keyboards which was problem when issues arose in WA

Next year will: Backup IT equipment to be held in state offices

No new ranges in Christmas lead up: Needed new range launch 17th Dec. Stores were looking flat

Next year will: Launch a new range early to mi December

Include update to front Gondola which looked tired by Christmas (4-6 weeks without updating)

Refund policy: required ID to be shown with receipt. Resulted in many customer complaints

Next year will: Refund policy updated to be provided upon any valid receipt (No ID required)
