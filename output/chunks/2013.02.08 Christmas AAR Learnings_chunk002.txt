[Document: 2013.02.08 Christmas AAR Learnings.docx]

Not having enough backup equipment: Eftpos, keyboards which was problem when issues arose in WA

Next year will: Backup IT equipment to be held in state offices

No new ranges in Christmas lead up: Needed new range launch 17th Dec. Stores were looking flat

Next year will: Launch a new range early to mi December

Include update to front Gondola which looked tired by Christmas (4-6 weeks without updating)

Refund policy: required ID to be shown with receipt. Resulted in many customer complaints

Next year will: Refund policy updated to be provided upon any valid receipt (No ID required)

Freight forwarder deliveries: Were late and mixed up by supplier making it harder to sort through with the larger volumes

Next year will: Change our freight forward providers

Sale signage: The sale signage message was not clear and resulted in a number of complaints

Next year will: clarify the nothing over message “on selected items”

The Good

3 for 2 mix and match gifts: 10% increase in LY ACS, became addictive and was executed well: next year will

replace the gift image with a ‘3 for 2’ sticker

disciplined on what items go in to avoid eroding margin

Christmas Wonderland Competition: Was huge success. Worked on a ‘ticketing’ competition where tickets allocated daily for achieving sales targets; bonus tickets allocated periodically; all went into a draw for final winners

Engineered sale product: pre-packaged especially so it could be wheeled in making it more efficient and in store by Christmas Eve. Product itself created consistency and volume

The Ugly

Stock allocation / logistics: didn’t build stock early and tail-off (issues with dynamic replen) – as a result we were playing catch up and making huge deliveries on peak days

Next year will: consistent and careful review of dynamic replenishment; proactive, forward planning approach on allocations

Overstock position (going into Nov): magnified all costs, stretched our supply chain and put pressure on early markdowns eroding our margin

Next year will: Make sure we’re not overstocked going into November

Candles out of stock: Factory behind on production, hit hard week 4 and 5 of December – was all magnified by failure to build stock early enough
