Retail Operations Academy

[Slide 3]

Lets get going…

Yesterday’s Numbers

<number>

[Slide 4]

What is a retail operations role?

<number>

[Slide 5]

Retail is and always has been hard and physical work.  If we want to avoid being crushed by our competition, you need to our product, out think, out plan, out work and out execute them…  52 weeks a year.

That’s an ongoing commitment you have to make to the strategy and tactics you have to have to win at retail.

WORK HARD

<number>

[Slide 6]

Why do we spend more of our time in stores than not?

What’s the purpose?

What’s the tactic?

What’s the benefit?

BE IN STORES

<number>

[Slide 7]

It’s about Her, always!

“Sorry I can’t sell you that, we’re stocktaking”

“… Because the customers come in”

“I felt like I was intruding in their space”

CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE

<number>

[Slide 8]

Success never happens because we hope or wish it will.  It happens because we decide what should happen, what needs to change, what our culture needs to be and what people need to be and then we need to get out and communicate, communicate, communicate any way that you can and as frequently as you can in words and in actions.

Don Soderquist

Communicate! Communicate! Communicate!

STANDARDS AND DISCIPLINES

<number>

[Slide 9]

Communicate, Communicate, Communicate.

<number>

[Slide 10]

Communication

Get everyone talking

Communicate, Communicate, Communicate

<number>

[Slide 11]

Communicate! Communicate! Communicate!

Communicate:

Formally			Test always for

Informally 			efficiency and

Speak				effectiveness

Write

Video

Message

In your every action

<number>

[Slide 12]

Communicate! Communicate! Communicate!

‘When I’ve told ‘em once, I’ll tells ‘em again and when I’ve told ‘em again, I’ll tells ‘em one more time.  And when I’ve told ‘em one more time, I find a way to tell ‘em again.’

When launching something new or hitting something hard that has fallen off its perch - six different times, in six different ways.  Continuous communication

<number>

[Slide 13]

Repetition

Communication is greatly aided by obsessive paranoia.  Fear that the message isn’t getting out.

Communication is greatly assisted by an enthusiastic delivery.

Communication is greatly assisted when the leaders are actioning and participating in whatever is being communicated.

Communication is a ‘rhythm thing’ – get into a rhythm, form the habit whenever you can

<number>

[Slide 14]

Remember to follow up

Never under estimate the impact that you, as leaders, have on your team and always remember that whatever you’re communicating has a greater impact than you think.

Never utter the words…But I told them..

<number>

[Slide 15]

Weekly Memo

Value of our weekly memo

The heart beat

Sets the pace

Sets the expectations

Sets the tone

Drives our values, who we are , what's important

<number>

[Slide 16]

Weekly Memo

The purpose:

Communication to the stores

Once a week – same day, same time  every week

All activities/instructions to be in that memo

All actions required to be completed weekly

Expectation that it gets done

Follow up is essential

<number>

[Slide 17]

Weekly Memo

Remember who your audience is

The lower you go in the organisation, the more often you have to deliver the message

Keep it simple

Flowery/fluffy stuff doesn’t work as well

Big words don’t work as well

Long messages don’t work as well

<number>

[Slide 18]

Front Page

Must be written by the CEO (cover page)

Inspirational/good news piece

Reasons behind why we do things - strategy, process

Your piece – educational/motivational

<number>

[Slide 19]

Pitfalls

You are the author

NRM approval on every single section

Needs to be in ‘store speak’

Your timeframe

Clear instruction

Nothing can be sent to the stores or any retail team unless in the weekly memo or SAM

This is controversial – let’s discuss

<number>

[Slide 20]

Tips

Involve state managers

Get your successor’s involved (i.e. state manager to write an article or critique your memo)

1/3 communication

1/3 education

1/3 motivation/inspiration

<number>

[Slide 21]

Tips

Test

Memo alone will never get the required traction

<number>

[Slide 22]

The SAM

The next level up

The why’s

The greater strategies

Issues of concern

Weeding the garden

What’s required/expected

Where we are going

<number>

[Slide 23]

Store Diary

Monthly

<number>

[Slide 24]

[Slide 25]

Store Diary Tips

If it isn’t being filled in or used as you designed it, you either don’t need it or you have a business issue to manage

Everything in one place

Remember our job is to make it easy for the store team to do their job

<number>

[Slide 26]

Store Diary and Weekly Memo
