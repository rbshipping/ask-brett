Measure the next results against your expected results

Customer Complaints

Are you aware that it is policy for all CEOs to take the initial call when we receive customer complaint?

A customer does us a huge favour by making a complaint

don’t get defensive

fix the customer issue immediately.

We take the customers side ‘perception is the reality’

address the business issue - the individual, the process, the procedure

Remember - ‘it’s about Her, always’!

[Slide 87]

Customer Complaint Reports

Eliminate the reasons why we say no to a customer and how we empower our teams to do whatever it takes to please the customer.
