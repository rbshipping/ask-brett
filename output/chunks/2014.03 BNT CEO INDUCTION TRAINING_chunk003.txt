[Presentation Topic: Customer Focus]

Please, going forward any termination where a payout exceeds what is in the contract (4 weeks) requires prior approval from myself. No exceptions.

Further no employment agreement can be entered into that exceeds 4 weeks termination notice, without my approval. No exceptions

Thanks,

Brett Blundy

Let's make it happen!

Communication

Get everyone talking

Communicate, Communicate, Communicate

[Slide 84]

Success never happens because we hope or wish it will.  It happens because we decide what should happen, what needs to change, what our culture needs to be and what people need to be and then we need to get out and communicate, communicate, communicate any way that you can and as frequently as you can in words and in actions.

Don Soderquist

Communicate! Communicate! Communicate!

83

[Slide 85]

Communicate

Your message

Your influence

84

[Slide 86]

Communicate! Communicate! Communicate!

Communicate:

Formally

Informally

Verbally

Written

In groups

One on one

Symbolic

In your every action

85

[Slide 87]

When I’ve told ‘em once, I’ll tells ‘em again and when I’ve told ‘em again, I’ll tells ‘em one more time.  And when I’ve told ‘em one more time, I find a way to tell ‘em again.

86

Communicate! Communicate! Communicate!

[Slide 88]

Communication

Communication is greatly aided by obsessive paranoia.  Fear that the message isn’t getting out.

Communication is greatly assisted by an enthusiastic delivery.

Communication is greatly assisted when the leaders are actioning and participating in whatever is being communicated.

Communication is a rhythm thing – get into a rhythm, form the habit.

87

[Slide 89]

Repetition

Communicate a new idea or way of doing things six different times, in six different ways

When launching something new or hitting something hard that has fallen off it’s perch - six different times, in six different ways.  Continuous communication

88

[Slide 90]

Communicate! Communicate! Communicate!

Remember to follow up

Never underestimate the impact that you, as leaders, have on your team and always remember that whatever you’re communicating, it has a greater impact than you think.

89

[Slide 91]

Weekly Memo

Value of our weekly memo

The memo alone will never get the required traction

90

[Slide 92]

Tips

Remember who your audience is

The lower you go in the organisation, the more often you have to deliver the message

Keep it simple

Flowery/fluffy stuff doesn’t work as well

Big words don’t work as well

91

[Slide 93]

The Purpose of the Weekly Memo

Communicates to the stores

Once a week – same day every week

All activities/instructions to be in that memo

All actions required to be completed weekly

Expectation that it gets done

Follow up is essential

92

[Slide 94]

Front Page

Must be written by you

Inspirational/good news piece

Reasons behind why we do things - strategy, processes

93

[Slide 95]

Pitfalls

NRM is the author

NRM approval on every single section

Nothing goes out without their approval

Nothing can be sent to the stores or any retail team unless in the weekly or SAM

94

[Slide 96]

Tips

Involve State Managers

Get your successor’s involved (i.e. State Managers to write an article or critique your memo)

1/3 communication

1/3 education

1/3 motivation/inspiration

95

[Slide 97]

The SAM

The next level up

The why’s

The greater strategies

Issues of concern

Weeding the garden

What’s required/expected

Where we are going

Objective meetings:

Turn talk and discussions into actions and outcomes that will stick.

Professionally acknowledging, recognising, discussing and informing on issues , opportunities and challenges – a tool to effect permanent solutions and change.

100

[Slide 102]

Management By Objectives

State the objective

Who is responsible?

Due date

Not a to do list

Not minutes of meetings

Objectives brought to the meeting

Discussion

Value add and support by leader

Your  chance to add objectives

101

[Slide 103]

Helps to identify:

The wins

Talkers who don’t do

Time wasters

Direct reports in the wrong job

Disorganisation

Problems early (management, process, people)

Going in the wrong direction

102

[Slide 104]

Why:

Keeps a record of what’s going on and agreed actions

Keeps all on track

Is efficient

Adds structure and rigour

Clear follow up

Issues are not forgotten, don't fall off

Ensures agreed accountability

A safe place to be candid

103

[Slide 105]

Fly by the seat of your pants

Make it up as you go along

‘I call them when I need to’

‘We talk all the time’

‘Our desks/offices are next to each other’

All will

let you down

104

[Slide 106]

Tips and things you must do:

Must have rhythm

1 hour max

Write up objectives as you go

You or your EA write the objective and agree the who and when (almost always the direct report, although delegation is appropriate and normal)

Admin support team can and should be utilized if appropriate

ASAP- a ‘no, no’

Ongoing – allowed but not ideal
