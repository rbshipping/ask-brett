Write up objectives as you go

You or your EA write the objective and agree the who and when (almost always the direct report, although delegation is appropriate and normal)

Admin support team can and should be utilized if appropriate

ASAP- a ‘no, no’

Ongoing – allowed but not ideal

Across the straight discount offer will

  Increase sales

  Excite the team

  Improve LFL

  Devalue our offering and product

  Negatively impact our brand

  Lowers our margin

  Never make up the lost $ margin with increased sales

  Reduces our profit

  Sell the best product leaving more aged and dogs to clear

  Produce out of stocks on best product (that sold already)

  Takes no imagination or creativity

The Science Behind OTB…

120

OTB

OTB is the gatekeeper of inventory management

It is the control that moderates the inventory we buy

Everyone is involved in the OTB process and has a specific role to play

OTB is a blunt instrument

[Slide 122]

Why the OTB process is so important

121

OTB is a formal process to ensure we keep track of exactly what $ we should commit to inventory to support the expected customer demand

The process ensures communication between buyers, merchandise planners as well as finance and the CEO to ensure we are being financially prudent to meet our strategic and operational objectives

The key control preventing us from being over or under stocked!

Overstock will force us to markdown eroding $GM and profits!

Over purchase does clog the OTB preventing fresh stock

Over purchase can, in the extreme, send us broke

Over purchase does disrupt good operations and effect morale

Over purchase does effect our brand

Over purchase does cause inefficiency and costs

Understock will have negative impact on sales

[Slide 123]

Skills Required for OTB

122

Emotional maturity

Ability to see the reality

Forecasting

Trend awareness

Understanding the year plan (peaks & troughs)

Disciplined: to be prepared on time (monthly with weekly auditing)

Strength of character: to withstand pressure from CEO’s to change forecasts

[Slide 124]

Common (issues) affecting OTB forecasting

123

No OTB process

Over ambitious forecasting

Orders placed not entered or entered inaccurately(bad processes)

Late deliveries

Data integrity issues

Not allowing for returns / faulties / samples / breakages

Not allowing for shrinkage

No awareness of building stock before it’s needed (pulling the OTB back)

CFO not and carrying out audits to ensure all processes that contribute or can effect accurate OTB forecasting are accurate and appropriate

CFO that does not play Devil’s advocate

CEO that overrides CFO

[Slide 125]

Common (issues) affecting OTB forecasting Continued…

124

Confusing OTB meetings with Merchandise Planning or re-ordering/replenishment meetings

Not allowing enough % of OTB for repeats or ongoing

All Product Team believe all their products and initiatives will sell

CFO not and carrying out audits to ensure all processes that contribute or can effect accurate OTB forecasting are accurate and appropriate

Product and product support team unaware of the impact and flow on of their work to the OTB forecasting

Not forecasting or inaccurately forecasting for unplanned product purchases (keeping some flexibility and $ in the back pocket)

Driving cash to hard

Not clearing “dogs” fast enough

Believing in miracles
