[Slide 12]

“I’ll have a view of where we’re going but I won’t have a hard and fast plan that goes beyond five years, because I have never been able to see a plan that’s set that far ahead.”

[Slide 15]

Three Things You Should Never Do

New store opening discounts

Stuff around with sale colours.  Sale is red and white - never anything different

Move clearance to the back of the store.  Markdown and clearance stays at the front of the store and always goes forward never back

[Slide 16]

Your Role as CEO

If we want to avoid being crushed by our competition, you need to out think, out plan, out work and out execute them…  52 weeks a year.

That’s an ongoing commitment you have to make to the strategy and tactics to win at retail.

15

[Slide 17]

Sustainable competitive advantage comes from three things:

Competence and attitude of our people

Speed in which we execute our strategies

A winning culture – build a winning culture and great teams will follow

16

[Slide 18]

Standards and disciplines

Whatever you decide to do, enforce and motivate to that end – no matter what the short term cost

[Slide 19]

Excellence

Excellence is good business

Excellence is good for the team

[Slide 20]

Be Humble

Arrogance and complacency are the most lethal enemies of strong:

Businesses

Brands

People

Products

Processes

Cultures

Everything

19

[Slide 21]

Get out of your office

Why do we spend time in the stores, DC, China, etc?

What is the purpose?

What is the tactic?

What is the benefit?

K.I.S.S.

Remove the impediments that get in the way of our team being able to do a good job…  Simplify everything, keep it simple

[Slide 24]

K.I.S.S.

The best ideas are the simplest ones; don’t let people complicate your business, because they will

Don’t let systems get in the way of doing business

26

[Slide 28]

Be on Top of Your Business

Know your numbers

27

[Slide 29]

Culture of continuous improvement…

28

[Slide 30]

Culture of continuous improvement…

Learning from doing…

Continuous improvement

29

[Slide 31]

Culture of continuous improvement…

It’s okay to try something new and fail - so long as you react quickly and learn from it

But… don’t bet the farm

30

[Slide 32]

Culture of continuous improvement…

If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it

What are you measuring?

What should you measure?

Christmas Reports

From: Brett Blundy Sent: Friday, 30 November 2012 12:32 PMTo: Nicole Noye; Peter Bohn: peter@divarussia.ru; David McLean (d.maclean@adairs.com.au); Shane Fallscheer; Michelle Kluz; Greg Milne; Eloise Monaghan; 'Janelle Barboza'; Tracey Blundy (tracey.blundy@bnt.com.au)Cc: Paul Grosmann; Jess KellySubject: Christmas Reports

Dear all,

I wanted to remind everyone as a part of our continuous improvement processes and culture, that it is imperative to ensure all of your department heads and up are preparing, thinking and will deliver a Christmas report.

The basis of the Christmas reports is to review what we did well, what we did badly and what we should or might do to improve and change for next Christmas and next year.

My experience is that you continuously need to write your notes as you go - anyone who does their reports from memory on 10 January will miss important points, issues and solutions.  The tip is to ensure everyone does their notes, puts it in a file and compiles in the new year.

The other thing that experience has taught me is that we tend to focus on product issues - it needs to be all things operational from rostering, training, process, procedures, timing, product, warehouse, distribution, pricing and merchandising.

Remember one of my favourite 10 plus 1 Culture Commitments - continuous improvement.  Christmas is the most vital time for us and we have to spend a part of our day thinking about what we do to improve for the following year.

The Christmas reports have been one of the important initiatives that has ensured we have been a great and improving company and has been a key driver to improved  Christmas execution and results.

Thanks and Merry Christmas

Brett Blundy

It’s about the customer, always!

“Sorry I can’t sell you that, we’re stocktaking”

“… Because the customers come in”

“I felt like I was intruding in their space”

37

[Slide 39]

In every discussion and every meeting, ask “how will this affect our customer?”

38

It’s about the customer, always!

[Slide 40]

It is never about what you’re doing – it is about what you’re doing for the customer!
