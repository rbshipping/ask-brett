Our academies

Often we are to busy ‘doing it’ to think about what we ‘are doing’ or ‘should be doing’

We never take enough time to ‘learn’ and apply the ‘learnings’

Because BBRC is has multiple brands we can share learnings and experiences

At the end of today it would be a great outcome if you are more able to do a good job

[Slide 5]

It’s about Her, always!

It’s about Her, always is misunderstood when it comes to product  – product is everything to do with the customer

Product that the customer wants

Meeting their needs to be:

Individual, hot, glamorous, beautiful, noticed, ‘out there’, bold, confident, trendy, daring, fashionable, rebellious, relaxed, spontaneous, generous

Healthy, clean, modern, noticed, trend setter, safe, role model:

As in wealthy, doing well, modern, environmental role model, spiritual, etc. etc.

Saucy, inner show girl, bombshell, sinister…

Our HISTORY

[Slide 12]

Our Product Evolution

Vertical retail brands vs. wholesale brands (speed, margin and value)

The name on the door is on the product

We must be fast……… not necessarily perfect

Only vertical will thrive/survive in specialty retail

12

[Slide 13]

Service and operational expertise has given way to product expertise

Our stores must be exciting for our customers – product is the main driver

What we (product team) do matters most – product is everything

Product is the big differentiator and the number 1 driver of our success

13

Our Product Evolution

[Slide 14]

Chief of Product

So product is everything, then what role does the CEO of specialty retail play?

CEO is head of product

Will be involved

Must be involved

Time allocation

Our MARKET

[Slide 16]

What's our market and why?

Main stream retail: we must have success in the main market

Don’t follow niche markets, sizing, trends – the “noisy minority”

Bed jackets

Dance

G Cup

[Slide 18]

Remember Her always

Getting to far ahead/behind of our customer:

Price

Product

Aspiration

Ignore your own emotions, likes, needs and wants

She needs “safe”

In the absence of being aware of this and checking in, we will drift ahead/behind of our customer

[Slide 24]

We buy for our customer, we don’t sell to our customer

“We buy for the customer, we don't sell to the customer, I have learned that product developers, buyers and retail organisations, including ours, generally have trouble understanding this and I should repeat it again and again.”

24

[Slide 25]

Emotional Connection

Our customer does not ‘need’ anything we sell

Our product must fill the ‘want’ and initiate an emotive reaction, we must have product that connects emotionally:

25

That’s SO beautiful

To die for

Such a great idea

Must have!!!

LOVE IT

HATE it…

[Slide 26]

Newness and innovation

26

Product is everywhere

….it has surrounded us

Reinvention and change is a constant - new, different, fresh, adapted and first…….

But not to first as first can be a dangerous place

[Slide 27]

Finding newness and innovation

Study your numbers – there are ‘gems’ in there

Discover why something worked/didn’t work – adapt

Talk to our team, customers, factories

“I am always looking” – online, magazines, competitors, local shopping centres, what are people wearing and doing?

Fairs

Overseas travel

Immerse yourself in the ‘life’ of our category – Live it! Breath it!

Newness and Innovation also comes via new fabrication, materials and technology (cheaper, better, stronger etc)

Champagne and canapés – beer and pizza

27

[Slide 28]

Put your ideas into action immediately:

Sign off or approval immediately

Disregard your bad ideas quickly

If appropriate go to the factory to get stuff started.

Tip – keep in mind you should pay for your trip by at least 10 times through executed ideas

If not, then do something different next time

28

Finding newness

[Slide 29]

Planning

Looking back and understanding what has happened is essential to product improvement (doing more of what is selling). Successfully looking forward is the key to ongoing success

Creativity comes into its own

The rubber meets the road

What's new, what's happening, what's tomorrow, what's exciting, what's not, what do we go after, what do we leave alone

29

[Slide 30]

Planning for the next big thing:

Evolution

Revolution

Reinvention

When does a trend/fashion become the next norm?

We want to be there

Today’s fashion, tomorrow’s basics
