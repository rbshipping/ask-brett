[Presentation Topic: Product Focus]

If not, then do something different next time

28

Finding newness

[Slide 29]

Planning

Looking back and understanding what has happened is essential to product improvement (doing more of what is selling). Successfully looking forward is the key to ongoing success

Creativity comes into its own

The rubber meets the road

What's new, what's happening, what's tomorrow, what's exciting, what's not, what do we go after, what do we leave alone

29

[Slide 30]

Planning for the next big thing:

Evolution

Revolution

Reinvention

When does a trend/fashion become the next norm?

We want to be there

Today’s fashion, tomorrow’s basics

Fad vs. long term big market e.g. structural change, health/environment/attitudes – indeed our very existence is this thinking, why we were created 35 years ago…

30

Newness and innovation

[Slide 31]

Planning tips

Categories growing/shrinking must be zero based

One in one out

Keep an eye on drifting to fringe

The overriding proviso is that all will change overtime through new, different, fresh and first

31

[Slide 32]

New categories and our role in there creation

Product extensions

Frocks – BNT

HB’s very existence comes from a new category

Body suits

Ear piercing

Sterling Silver

32

[Slide 33]

Understanding “less is more”

It’s too easy to fall into the trap of more and more product

Depth and width of ranging – we tend to go too wide and too deep (usually because we are unclear or unsure)

Less is more

Afraid to give something up

Hang on to the last

Belief that if we put in more options, we sell more

33

[Slide 34]

One In One Out

34

Please understand this simple principle

[Slide 35]

How do these work together?

35

We work our store space hard

High stock intensity

‘Less is more’

[Slide 36]

Doing more with what we have

Make big, BIGGER:

More colours

Sizes

Create category

See the gems that you can breathe life into – make small big

Examples:

Wash bag

Swarovski crystal

36

[Slide 37]

Doing more with what we have

Launches – it’s important

Why

How

When

Retail team: our secret success for marketing and exciting our customers

If we are not ‘launching’ we are probably, at best, lacking innovation and excitement for our customers and team and at worst, not staying relevant

Your role in this

Testing

We never do enough testing

Time

Not pushing the boundaries

Lack of confidence

Testing is gold!

Testing lifts your success and sell through % and GM$

Always be testing:

Xmas

For trends

Adaptions

Colours

New ideas

Gold vein

We must hit gold veins regularly

Above all else, our job is to keep creating product that fits the criteria of ‘must have’, emotive, on trend, innovative, new fresh and first! Add awareness and testing to this and a gold vein is coming

When we hit that gold we mine for all it's worth

Speed and urgency

We often miss gold veins that are staring us in the face

When something is selling well you are often very close to a gold vein

44

[Slide 45]

Gold vein

When you have hit a gold vein – get onto the next one

Know when to ‘get out’

Failure will follow if you don’t get going again

Complacency

Living on yesterday’s success

Tips to keep in MIND

[Slide 47]

Know your stuff

Know your business well, be on top of all aspects of your product role:

Be interested

Know what your product costs

Know the retail price

Know your margin

Know  the quantity you sell by week

Know what's on order and the quantity

Study if you have to

These are all signs of your commitment to and confidence in your role

47

[Slide 48]

Measure your performance

Measure your performance

Units sold

Sell trough %

First margin, final margin

If you don’t understand or are not getting this info, get it and understand it

48

[Slide 49]

Listening to our customers/team is risky…

….not listening to our customers/team is even more risky

49

Listening…

[Slide 50]

Pricing and margin management

There is no secret formula on margin requirement – we price to what the customer will buy

There is no margin policy (just tell me what you want!!!)

Specialist vertical retail is about maximize your margin

Price driven retail is about cost plus fixed margin

We must know our customer, market and business

If we cannot make ‘the margin’ (at the right retail), then we cannot range the product!

But if the product is right we must range it! – we don’t meet min margin by putting the retail up

50

[Slide 51]

Margin management

It’s not the first margin that matters, it’s the final margin

Suppliers and price negotiation

They want to put their prices up, always

Prey on product creative people

Use every manner of justification

Any story that will run:

Wages

Tax

Socialisation

Cotton prices

Metal prices

New prices

New laws

Exchange rates

And they are convincing

57

[Slide 58]

Know the retail price that you want before they give you the cost

The first price is never the price

Changing, downgrading or re-’spec’ing is rarely the answer in a cost negotiation

Leave plenty of time for the Negotiation - saving face

Be ready and able to move on from a product (options and time)

MOQ if we cannot order the quantity we need, then we cannot order

Suppliers and product negotiation
