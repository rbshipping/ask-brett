[Document: 2015 BUYING ACADEMY_FINAL.pptx]
[Presentation Topic: Product Focus]

Know the retail price that you want before they give you the cost

The first price is never the price

Changing, downgrading or re-’spec’ing is rarely the answer in a cost negotiation

Leave plenty of time for the Negotiation - saving face

Be ready and able to move on from a product (options and time)

MOQ if we cannot order the quantity we need, then we cannot order

Suppliers and product negotiation

[Slide 59]

Suppliers: Tip 1

Plan to pay for your trip

Opportune buying

Overruns

Cancelled orders

59

[Slide 60]

Find, visit and test new suppliers regularly

Test: never give an essential product or a big order to a new supplier - no matter what the issue, opportunity or incentive

Suppliers: Tip 2

[Slide 61]

Suppliers: Tip 3

24 hour response time

Ring or email when something is good (besides being motivational, it will make it easier when you call and need their help… and they can help!)

Treat them as important, in your manner and attitude

Visit more often than you think you need to

Open To Buy (OTB)

69

Why we have Open to Buy

It tells us exactly how much we are allowed to spend on product each month

Is the key control to prevent us from being overstocked or understocked

It’s a blunt instrument that forces communication between buyers, merchandise planners, finance and the CEO

[Slide 70]

What is your role in open to buy?

Make sure we are meeting customer demand

Make sure we have fresh stock coming in

Make sure there is a little buffer for when we find a gold-vein or a ‘must have’

Challenge the current trends or market shares of categories

70

Open To Buy

[Slide 71]

What is Data Integrity?

71

Is about how accurately the product physically in our stores is reflected in our system

Physical quantity of items versus system quantity

Physical price of item versus system price

Getting data integrity right is critical to sales

Overstocks (mark downs)

Missed sales

Also important because future decisions / forecasts are based on historic sales data – if this data is wrong, we can end up making wrong decisions

Fraud

[Slide 72]

What is your role in data integrity?

Make sure orders are accurately placed (quantity, cost price [freight, exchange rate, duties etc.] and retail price)

Minimise last minute updates (to prevent suppliers from making mistake)

72

Data Integrity

[Slide 73]

Very trendy, generally more expensive than rest of assortment

Image enhancer

"one and done" (no replen: Sell-through or mark-down in short time frame)

Often bought to minimum order quantities

Seasonal SKUs, but less trendy than "fashion"

Product in store for 2-6 months

Sell-through, but mark down to clear out at end of season

Used to identify "new" anchors/basics

Typically some replen

Long-term styles

carry through of >12 months, or cyclical

Typically larger buys, with several Key Items

Generally, largest profit share

Sales driven by competitive pricing

Replenishment and ensuring "never out of stock" critical

Range

Reviews

[Slide 76]

Range Preparation

If you are not planning……..you are planning to fail

76

[Slide 77]

Range reviews: Purpose at a high level

Understand performance of your Buy

Find out what particular ranges and items did well/didn’t do well, and why

Determine if/how items range should be repeated

Learn from each other’s range/item performance and document findings for future buying decisions

Make decisions on whether to shift spend on Buy to other categories

77

[Slide 78]

Range reviews: 3 different types

Systematic, thorough review of how the product ranges (the Buy) have performed

Generally, run in 3 different cycles:

Weekly (Mondays – I never met a retailer that did this on a different day!)

Check how ranges are performing, make decisions on repeats, DC stock, markdowns, and range rollout based on how performance is trending

Primarily focused  on GM$, SOH, and a read on new reactions. Best if conducted in the product room so team can point to products

Semi-regular (monthly or seasonal – generally 4-12 times per year)

Review total range performance relative to LY (GM$, turns, GMROI, sales vs. SOH)

Takeaway learnings on overall performance and what to do differently going forward

Semi-annual (generally 1-2X/year):

Review performance of range over time to decide shifts in investment by category, product attributes, price architecture, and store grading

78

[Slide 79]

Semi-regular range reviews: Attendees

Attendees:

Head of Buying

Buying team (how deep down depends on organisation structure/size)

Merch Planning

CEO

Head of Retail?

Practical tips for setting these up:

Time box each range/set a schedule in advance; first ranges reviewed tend to get inordinate amount of time

Nominate a “secretary” to take down key points/decisions to circulate after the range review; it can be a long session and it can be useful for recall

If org is big, do not bring whole Buying team; focus tends to get lost

Bring actual product to discuss – in fact, best if whole range is available for discussion

Core. Buying

Driven!

[Slide 80]

Semi-regular range reviews: 3 main levels of analyses to prepare beforehand

Performance analysis on overall assortment:

Performance of whole assortment, ranked by product category:

GMROI, sales to buy, GM%, and ASP this year vs. last year
