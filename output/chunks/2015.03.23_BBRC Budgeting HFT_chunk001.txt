Top 5 plus one suggestions for consideration

1. Start by answering: “How are we going to blow right through last year’s

numbers?”

2. Go top down, and look for the POTENTIAL

3. Ensure your business as a whole grows

4. Golden Rule: CODB as a % of sales must collectively come down

5. Be transparent with the numbers to keep people engaged

Plus one: Know your business and know it well, keep it realistic and objective

Use the BIP as a tool to look for new (better) ideas, ways,

technologies, opportunities etc.
