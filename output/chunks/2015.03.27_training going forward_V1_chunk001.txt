[Presentation Topic: Knowledge Sharing]

[Slide 1]

BBRC knowledge sharing (and Greg’s role)

<number>

It’s about Her, Always!

27 March 2015

For Discussion at Brett/Jason 1:1

[Slide 2]

How do we share knowledge from BBRC Head Office?

<number>

High Focus

Academies

E-mail Specific

At least one every 6 weeks

Short, sharp, discussion-led 1 hour sessions

Brett (for discussion if this could be Greg) is chair and introduces 1-2 pages on the topic

Target 6-10 attendees (CEOs and “CEO-designates”)

Aim to be more general management focused than retail skewed

As soon as 1 finishes, the invite and reading follows on immediately for the next one

Invite will include 1 to 3 questions for CEOs to send answers through approx 3 days prior

Approximately five a year

Aim to be more retail focused than High Focus or E-mail Specific topics – it is important to keep the different formats distinct for them to have meaning

At least 1 a year led by Brett, the rest by other leaders across the group (include Tracey?)

Comprehensive full-day programme

Pre-read and preparatory work sent out at least 2 days in advance

No MORE than 1 every 2 weeks – otherwise with High Focus, Bulletins and these, they will just start to get ignored

They have to be meaningfully staggered and consistent in timing to maintain interest, and not just a short flurry of activity

Reasonably short and focused e-mail (no more than 3 paragraphs), with short article if required

Senior leaders (CEOs and their direct reports), but will vary based on topic

Try and use videos where good content can be found

Topics to be reinforced through the bulletin as appropriate

What could Greg do?

<number>

Lead the Technology Academy in May 2015 – already agreed and happening

Do the 2 High Focus Topics when BB is away, plus 2 others in the next 12 months

July 2015: CEOs role in Product

August 2015: The Importance of Measurement and Accountability

November 2015: A Sense of Urgency

April 2016: CODB

Do the AAR relaunch in June 2015 (will include a HFT and an e-mail/training piece)

At least 3 further academies in the next 12 months

Looks like there is room for an additional one end of October 2015

And 2 more early 2016 (e.g. February and April)

Topics could include Christmas AAR, DC, Work Outs… what else?

Potential “titles” for consideration….

Chief Learning Officer

Learning & Development Director

Knowledge Director

Learning & Knowledge Director

Other suggestions could include

Co-ordinate the Knowledge Sharing Week if it’s something we decide to do (see next page)

Permanently give Greg 1 page in the Bulletin for a learning and development topic

Longer term launch of an e-learning series on all of the academy topics for the brands (might not be worthwhile?)

[Slide 5]

SUGGESTION: “Knowledge Sharing Week” – 3rd or 4th week of August

<number>

MAY: Introduce to CEOs in HFT on “The Importance of Knowledge Sharing”

Ask for their suggestions as part of the call, what they think we all could be doing better to share knowledge, and if we were to do a Knowledge Sharing Week, what would they like to see included?

JULY: Formal launch 1 month in advance (if there is sufficient positive feedback from CEOs)

BBRC Group Survey (using HBS one) will go out

Release of the BB “What I learned at Harvard” article, so it goes out in more than just a random e-mail

AUGUST: Actual Knowledge Sharing week (Headline along lines of “… so, what would you like to know?”)

Video released on “What are our gems?”, featuring Tracey, Sanj, Shane, Nico, Brett, Ray, Darren and Greg

OR thinking bigger, do it as a live webcast ‘round table’ with all of the above in person discussing the gems (as there 8 attendees, we could 2 round tables of 4, addressing 2 different topics)

Get a meeting room in Sydney, have Sydney BBRC attendees in person, and everyone else can watch over the web

There can be a Q&A session, and we can do it that people watching over a webcast can submit questions (like how investor relations conferences are done)

Will have to look into costs

Each BBRC Group operating company to do it’s own Knowledge Sharing events within the week, e.g.

CEOs pick a topic to talk to their senior leadership team

At support office spend an hour learning about what another department does

People in support office get out to stores/DC and learn about stores/DCs for a morning

Some kind of quiz competition (“how well do you know X?”)

Hopefully the survey/CEOs will suggest other initiatives
