Communication

February 2016

BBRC

BB Intro – 5 key takeaways from today

1. We have many options as to

how we communicate with our

teams (especially with tech)

2. We can’t let communication be

“stagnant” – it needs to evolve

3. Everything we do is a form of

communication (i.e. our

actions not just our words)

4. Use 1:1s and weekly memos to

create rhythm (but they have

to be done properly)

5. Communication needs to flow

ACROSS organisations
