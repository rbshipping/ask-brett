There are two fundamental goals underscoring most transformations:

Become more effective or efficient

At Kotter, we continue to evolve our thinking, informed by our work

and have enhanced our8-step process

to give organizations additional capabilities to lead change under the particular

conditions of today’s warp-speed world. First introduced in Accelerate, published

by Harvard Business Review Press in 2014, we have broadened the scope of the

8-Step Process from its original version, giving it reach and potency today and

beyond.

STEP

CREATE A SENSE OF URGENCY

it all starts here…

Your top leaders must describe an opportunity that will appeal to individuals’ heads +

hearts, and use this statement to raise a large, urgent army of volunteers.

Over many decades, Dr. Kotter’s (and others’) research has shown that most transformation

efforts fail. A consistent factor behind those failed transformations is that a sense of urgency

was not generated and sustained.

Building urgency is all about concentrating on a window of opportunity that is open today

but may close tomorrow. Such an opportunity brings people together, aligning them around a

commonality, and clarifying where energy should be directed.

CREATE A SENSE OF URGENCY

Do you see a Big Opportunity that could ignite the

hearts + minds of your people?

What is your Big

Do you know how to identify, articulate and

communicate it?

Opportunity?

Are you able to connect an external change factor with

a special capability of your organization?

What are the stakes if you succeed? What are the

consequences if you fail?

WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY ARE APPEARING MORE QUICKLY

THAN EVER. IDENTIFYING AN OPPORTUNITY QUICKLY,

AND MOBILIZING URGENCY AROUND IT,

IS BECOMING THE KEY TO BEATING COMPETITORS.

STEP

BUILD A GUIDING COALITION

The Guiding Coalition is, in many ways, the nerve center of the 8-Step Process. It can

take many shapes, but must consist of members from multiple layers of the hierarchy,

represent many functions, receive information about the organization at all levels and

ranks, and synthesize that information into new ways of working.

Without a Guiding Coalition, the organization will continue to rely on traditional, hierarchical ways

of operating which often act in ways that kill off, rather than accelerate, needed change.

STEP

FORM A STRATEGIC VISION AND INITIATIVES

Dr. Kotter defines strategic initiatives as targeted and coordinated activities that, if

designed and executed fast enough and well enough, will make your vision a reality.
