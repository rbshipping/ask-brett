STEP

FORM A STRATEGIC VISION AND INITIATIVES

Dr. Kotter defines strategic initiatives as targeted and coordinated activities that, if

designed and executed fast enough and well enough, will make your vision a reality.

STEP

ENLIST A VOLUNTEER ARMY

Large-scale change can only occur when very significant numbers of employees amass

under a common opportunity and drive in the same direction.

Accelerate explains that "history has demonstrated that it is possible to find many change

agents … but only if people are given a choice, and feel they truly have permission to step

forward and act." You must build excitement around the Big Opportunity and develop a

feeling that one ”wants to" (vs. ”has to") contribute.

ENABLE ACTION BY REMOVING BARRIERS

In order to remove barriers, you must identify them.

Think about why past initiatives have failed. At what

stage? Did they get off the ground at all? Stall mid-way?

Get completed but then abandoned?

How to spot

Barriers can be commonly accepted statements that,

Barriers

while appearing helpful, can deter attempts to get past

legacy obstacles. These are statements like, "It's just not

done that way," or "We tried that before — it didn't

work.”

Common barriers include: silos, parochialism, pressure to

hit numbers, complacency, legacy rules or procedures,

and limited access to key stakeholders and leaders.

STEP

GENERATE SHORT-TERM WINS

Wins are the molecules of results. They must be collected, categorized and

communicated – early and often – to track progress and energize your volunteers to

drive change.

A win is anything – big or small – that helps you move toward your opportunity.

They may take the shape of actions taken, a lesson learned, a process improved, a

new behavior demonstrated, etc.

STEP

SUSTAIN ACCELERATION

Press harder after the first successes. Your increasing credibility can improve systems,

structures and policies. Be relentless with initiating change after change until the vision is a

reality.

So you’ve had a few wins. It can be easy to lift your foot off the gas pedal after

experiencing some success. Instead, this is the time to press harder and use those

wins as momentum to further fuel the change.
