STEP INSTITUTE CHANGE

To ensure new behaviors are repeated over the long term, it's important that you

define and communicate the connections between those behaviors and the

organization's success.

Years of a different kind of experience are often needed to create lasting change. That is why

cultural changes come once you are deep into a transformation, not at the beginning. You

first have to build the muscle and track record of antithetical experiences. Culture changes

after you have successfully altered people’s actions, connecting the dots between new

behaviors and better performance.

muscles, new behaviors and new ways of working.

Accelerator 8 is about sustaining it long into the

future.

New practices must be deeply rooted and

anchored to replace the old ways.

Making it stick

There must be clear communication and

synchronization between the traditional

hierarchical structure and the innovative network

of volunteers.

A key challenge is grafting the new practices onto

roots that may be old but still effective, while

killing off the inconsistent pieces.

At the end of a transformation, your org chart might look a little different.

Your hierarchy will still be in place, as it’s critical for day-to-day operations. But,

in addition, you’ll now have a constantly innovating and poised to jump
