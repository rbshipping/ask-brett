AFTER ACTION REVIEW (AAR) – CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

An AAR is an incredibly simple but powerful tool that allows individuals and teams to continuously learn from their everyday experiences. In essence, at the end of every event, a number of questions are asked:

What did we set out to do?

What did we actually do?

What were the differences?

What was learnt?

Events

An AAR is held at the end of an event.  An AAR can be held by an individual with his or her line manager after a small every day task or it can be conducted by two or three people at the end of a meeting. It can be held by a small project team say at the end of a conference or by the senior management team at the end of a large internal project/meeting/task.  Here are a few examples of events:

Store Openings/ Closings

An internal meeting – with supplier

Conferences/  Training Workshops

IT upgrade/ installation of new software

Follow Up

Without question the most important part of any meeting is the actual follow up.

Identify tasks/areas that require re training / re designing

Fix the problem – re train immediately, revise current policy/procedure

Maintain focus on processes and desired outcomes

Constantly review and seek ways to improve

Key things to remember

Keep the focus on the process, not the people

Honest expression is critical – ensure complaints are handled positively

Don’t turn it into a critique or lecture

Immediacy is the key to success – AARs should be held as soon as possible after the event

Remember you aren’t there to judge success or failure

Involve all the participants for maximum benefit

Share the information you have learnt

Apply the learning

Communicate how the learning has been applied
