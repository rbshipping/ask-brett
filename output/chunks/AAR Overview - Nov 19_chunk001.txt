“It is important to correct things, but it is more important

to correct thinking”

Key Things to Remember for an AAR

Remind everybody why we are doing OKRs and their importance to continuous improvement and their learning.

Keep the focus on the process, not people.

Keep focused on actions and outcomes, not fault.

Honest expression is critical – ensure complaints are handled positively

Don’t turn it into a critique or lecture

Immediacy is the key to success – AARs should be held as soon as possible after the event.

You aren’t there to judge success or failure ––“What went wrong?”.

Involve all the participants for maximum benefit.

Share the information you have learnt.

Apply the learning.

Communicate how the learning has been applied.
