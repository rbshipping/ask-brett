Standards and Disiplines

[Slide 15]

Success never happens because we hope or wish it will.  It happens because we decide what should happen, what needs to change, what our culture needs to be and what people need to be and then we need to get out and communicate, communicate, communicate any way that you can and as frequently as you can in words and in actions.
