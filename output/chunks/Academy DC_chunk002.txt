Catch Phrase:

“See and recognize what needs to be done.”

Sustain

Catch Phrase:

“The less self-discipline you need, the better.”

[Slide 73]

Sustain – What Is It?

Effective, ongoing application of knowledge, skills, and abilities gained from the 5S process.

“Sustain” is often the most difficult part of the 5S process

[Slide 74]

Keep it Fun

Use friendly competition to encourage continued excitement about the productivity of 5S

Work as a team to achieve the combined goal of using 5S effectively in the workplace

Take before and after photographs of the area that 5S is applied to provide evidence of progress

Provide positive reinforcement for good 5S practices (lunch parties, movie tickets, gift certificates, etc.)

Provide individual recognition or rewards for success and/or progress

[Slide 84]

Communicate, Communicate, Communicate.

[Slide 85]

Communication

Get everyone talking

Communicate, Communicate, Communicate

[Slide 86]

Communicate! Communicate! Communicate!

Communicate:

Formally

Informally

Speak

Write

Video

Message

In your every action

[Slide 87]

Communicate! Communicate! Communicate!

‘When I’ve told ‘em once, I’ll tells ‘em again and when I’ve told ‘em again, I’ll tells ‘em one more time.  And when I’ve told ‘em one more time, I find a way to tell ‘em again.’

When launching something new or hitting something hard that has fallen off its perch - six different times, in six different ways.  Continuous communication

[Slide 88]

Repetition

Communication is greatly aided by obsessive paranoia.  Fear that the message isn’t getting out

Communication is greatly assisted by an enthusiastic delivery

Communication is greatly assisted when the leaders are actioning and participating in whatever is being communicated

Communication is a ‘rhythm thing’ – get into a rhythm, form the habit whenever you can

[Slide 89]

Remember to follow up

Never underestimate the impact that you, as leaders, have on your team and always remember that whatever you’re communicating has a greater impact than you think.

Never utter the words…’But I told them…’

[Slide 90]

One Question

[Slide 91]

Management By Objectives

(One on ones)

[Slide 92]

Objective Meetings

Turn talk and discussions into actions and outcomes that will stick.

Professionally acknowledging, recognising, discussing and informing on issues , opportunities and challenges – a tool to effect permanent solutions and change.

[Slide 93]

Management By Objectives

State the objective

Who is responsible?

Due date

Not a to do list

Not minutes of meetings

Objectives brought to the meeting

Discussion

Value add and support by leader

Your chance to add objectives

[Slide 94]

Helps to identify:

Talkers who don’t do

Time wasters

Direct reports in the wrong job

Disorganisation

Problems early (management, process, people)

Going in the wrong direction

The wins

[Slide 95]

Why:

Keeps a record of what’s going on and agreed actions

Keeps all on track

Is efficient

Adds structure and rigour

Clear follow up

Issues are not forgotten, don't fall off

Ensures agreed accountability

[Slide 96]

Fly by the seat of your pants

Make it up as you go along

‘I call them when I need to’

‘We talk all the time’

‘We work together’

All will

let you down

[Slide 97]

Tips and things you must do:

Must have rhythm

1 hour maximum

Write up objectives as you go

You write the objective and agree to the who and when (almost always the direct report, although delegation is appropriate and normal)

Administration support team can and should be utilised if appropriate

ASAP- a ‘no, no’

Ongoing – allowed but not ideal

[Slide 98]
