“Complacency is the most dangerous trap any manager can fall into”  Peter Drucker, Harvard Business School

BB Thoughts

Don’t let systems get in the way of doing business

If you want to change behaviour -  wrong barcodes, late deliveries, etc you have to charge them, have a consequence and this includes in house as well

DCs are extreme environments - never talk or acknowledge that it is too hot or too cold

Where do your team go if they have a grievance?  Do they know?

Christmas rostering

Christmas motivation/super busy periods

- preparing for weekend work, split shifts, etc.

Continuously request that you are given better information on activities that drive your DC workload
