BB Planning

Cash is king

The only thing that matters is cash

We expense everything, we do don’t capitalize……….our profits are real

Cash is the measure that matters most

Support centre costs are applied to all stores our store profit after support centre allocation is the only profit measure

The idea that a new store does not change the support centre cost is delusion and is never found to be true
