Subject: Dictaphone Note - Pre-sale and Merchandising Planning Session

Need to put together a two day course with regards to pre‐sale and merchandise planning.

 Checking for your tail

 Markdown strategies using live data, 3.

 Your first markdown is your best markdown

 Week’s cover will double every week

 When should you be out of sale, when can you throw product out

 When do you take second markdowns

 How many are the right markdowns, etc.
