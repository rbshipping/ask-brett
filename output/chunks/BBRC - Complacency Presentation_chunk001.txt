How do we Combat the Complacency Curve?

First :We recognize and believe the issue is real

Hard to do.

Second: Double down on our winning culture.

It’s the antidote.

Get back to “Day 1” attitude.

just getting started

never arrived

never satisfied

(hard to do when bonuses and applauses are continuous).

Regression towards the mean

6

Why?

Because the world is made up by ‘the average’.

- Average people

- Average outputs

- Average motivation

- Average focus, etc

Mediocrity is constantly at work pulling us back to the average.

Because we are human.

Most all great business creations

regress over time to the average.
