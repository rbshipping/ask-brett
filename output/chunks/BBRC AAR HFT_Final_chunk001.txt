BB Intro – what are we talking about today?

<number>

After Action Reviews (or AARs) – a key part of the “BBRC WAY”

Key situations become opportunities to learn

Way to build, store and retain important knowledge

Important to see them as not just “meetings” or “post mortems” to talk about what happened…

…they need to lead to change, and lessons need to be remembered

We will discuss examples of how to best use AARs, traps to avoid and whether there is merit to BARs (Before Action Reviews)

The VIDEO and the ARTICLE are both excellent sources for training your teams

“Companies that master this process gain—and sustain—competitive advantage. They avoid repeating the kinds of errors that gnaw away at stakeholder value. And instead of merely fixing problems, they adapt more rapidly and effectively than rivals to challenges no one even imagined.”

Harvard Business Review, 2005

[Slide 4]

DISCUSSION POINT 1

<number>

Explain the most effective AAR you were a part of. What happened and why?

[Slide 5]

DISCUSSION POINT 2

<number>

Think of a time when things to change were identified in an AAR, but the mistakes ended up being repeated. How did this happen?

[Slide 6]

DISCUSSION POINT 3

<number>

The HBR article talks about BARs and AARs – do you think there’s value in the BAR?

[Slide 7]

When to use AARs in our businesses? – a few suggestions only…

<number>

Sale

Christmas/Easter/Mother’s Day etc. – key events

Buying trips

Range days

New product/major product launch

Other major supplier negotiations (e.g. leases, licences, software)

Retail

Property

Major lease negotiations

An acquisition of a new centre (operational AAR and negotiation AAR)

Centre launch

Completion of any development work/asset improvement

[Slide 8]

Transforming an AAR from a “meeting” to a source of sustainable competitive advantage

<number>

The “meeting” is just part of the AAR process or regimen – it is a “cycle” which only completes when the event is repeated

Link lessons learned directly to future actions (e.g. “this happened and because of that next time person X will do action Y” and/or “every action is either a (i) sustain (ii) stop or (iii) improve”)

Re-visit before the event is repeated

“It is important to correct things, but it is more important

to correct thinking”
