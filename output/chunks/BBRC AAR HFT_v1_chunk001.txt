BB Intro – what are we talking about today?

<number>

After Action Reviews (or AARs) – a key part of the “BBRC WAY”

Key situations become opportunities to learn

Way to build, store and retain important knowledge if there is team turnover

Important to see them as not just “meetings” or “post mortems” to talk about what happened…

…they need to lead to change, and lessons need to be remembered

We will discuss examples of how to best use AARs, traps to avoid and whether there is merit to BARs

The VIDEO and the ARTICLE are both excellent sources for training your teams

“Companies that master this process gain—and sustain—competitive advantage. They avoid repeating the kinds of errors that gnaw away at stakeholder value. And instead of merely fixing problems, they adapt more rapidly and effectively than rivals to challenges no one even imagined.”

Harvard Business Review, 2005

[Slide 4]

DISCUSSION POINT 1

<number>

Explain the most effective AAR you were a part of. What happened and why?

[Slide 5]

DISCUSSION POINT 2

<number>

Think of a time when things to change were identified in an AAR, but the mistakes ended up being repeated. How did this happen?

[Slide 6]

DISCUSSION POINT 3

<number>

The HBR article talks about BARs and AARs – do you think there’s value in the BAR?

[Slide 7]

Transforming an AAR from a “meeting” to a source of sustainable competitive advantage

<number>

A supportive learning environment

Concrete learning processes and practices

The “meeting” is just part of the AAR process or regimen – it is a “cycle” which only completes when the event is repeated

A Learning Organisation

Psychological safety

Appreciation of differences

Openness to new ideas

Time for reflection

Internal (e.g. AARs)

External training

Generation

Collection

Interpretation

Dissemination

Probing questions

Lead through example

Attentive listening

Time and resources to learning

Link lessons learned directly to future actions (e.g. “this happened and because of that next time person X will do action Y)

Re-visit before the event is repeated
