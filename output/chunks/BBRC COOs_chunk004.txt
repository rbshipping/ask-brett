Any retail executive that reaches for an across the store discount as a creative driver of profits is kidding themselves or has no idea

Across the store discounting (continued)

Across the straight discount offer will

  Increase sales

  Excite the team

  Improve LFL

  Devalue our offering and product

  Negatively impact our brand

  Lowers our margin

  Never make up the lost $ margin with increased sales

  Reduces our profit

  Sell the best product leaving more aged and dogs to clear

  Produce out of stocks on best product (that sold already)

  Takes no imagination or creativity

  Is inconsistent with fashion forward

  Is discount mentality

The Science Behind OTB…

97

OTB

OTB is the gatekeeper of inventory management

It is the control that moderates the inventory we buy

Everyone is involved in the OTB process and has a specific role to play

OTB is a blunt instrument

[Slide 99]

Why the OTB process is so important

98

OTB is a formal process to ensure we keep track of exactly what $ we should commit to inventory to support the expected customer demand

The process ensures communication between buyers, merchandise planners as well as finance and the COO to ensure we are being financially prudent to meet our strategic and operational objectives

The key control preventing us from being over or under stocked!

Overstock will force us to markdown eroding $GM and profits!

Over purchase does clog the OTB preventing fresh stock

Over purchase can, in the extreme, send us broke

Over purchase does disrupt good operations and effect morale

Over purchase does effect our brand

Over purchase does cause inefficiency and costs

Understock will have negative impact on sales

[Slide 100]

Skills Required for OTB

99

Emotional maturity

Ability to see the reality

Forecasting

Trend awareness

Understanding the year plan (peaks & troughs)

Disciplined: to be prepared on time (monthly with weekly auditing)

Strength of character: to withstand pressure from COO’s to change forecasts

[Slide 101]

Common (issues) affecting OTB forecasting

100

No OTB process

Over ambitious forecasting

Orders placed not entered or entered inaccurately(bad processes)

Late deliveries

Data integrity issues

Not allowing for returns / faulties / samples / breakages

Not allowing for shrinkage

No awareness of building stock before it’s needed (pulling the OTB back)

CFO not and carrying out audits to ensure all processes that contribute or can effect accurate OTB forecasting are accurate and appropriate

CFO that does not play Devil’s advocate

COO that overrides CFO

[Slide 102]

Common (issues) affecting OTB forecasting Continued…

101

Confusing OTB meetings with Merchandise Planning or re-ordering/replenishment meetings

Not allowing enough % of OTB for repeats or ongoing

All Product Team believe all their products and initiatives will sell

CFO not and carrying out audits to ensure all processes that contribute or can effect accurate OTB forecasting are accurate and appropriate

Product and product support team unaware of the impact and flow on of their work to the OTB forecasting

Not forecasting or inaccurately forecasting for unplanned product purchases (keeping some flexibility and $ in the back pocket)

Driving cash to hard

Not clearing “dogs” fast enough

Believing in miracles

[Slide 103]

Common (issues) affecting OTB forecasting Continued…

102

Delegation of OTB Planning to Merchandise Planning

Being too strict / Being too loose (near enough is good enough)

Unrealistic markdown forecasting

More than one OTB meeting per month.  You are overthinking the process

Weekly meetings should not have the word OTB mentioned

Forecasting to far ahead

Forecasting behind product planning

Building shortfalls in stock i.e. under stocked to quickly

Cutting OTB to aggressively and quickly to address over stocks

Ignoring overstocks……..some body must pay the piper

[Slide 104]

Data integrity

What is data integrity?

Why is it so important?
