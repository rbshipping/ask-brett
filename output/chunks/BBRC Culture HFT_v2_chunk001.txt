BB Intro – what are we talking about today?

<number>

Getting Culture right is even more important than we think it is

It needs to be deliberately enforced, corrected and protected (and if you don’t do it, it will happen anyway in an unintentional way…)

We have a newly formatted 10 PLUS 1 – use it as an opportunity to make sure our teams know about and it’s getting used

Culture and employee engagement are tightly linked – so getting culture right is efficient and powerful from a recruitment perspective

At a senior level, INNOVATION needs to be cultural – how are we doing this? We should start with getting this embedded

One of the only truly unique sources of competitive advantage

“The responsibility of our leaders is to ‘walk the talk’, ‘paint the picture’ and ‘tell the story’ of what is truly important”

Communicate, Communicate, Communicate!

Additional thoughts…

<number>

Employees are always watching for your cues (a reminder from the “Taste of Harvard” seminar)

Out of 10 instances, if you as a leader behave in a “culturally appropriate” way 9 times, but slip up once – it is this one time that your teams will remember

There needs to be no ambiguity on the most important things that matter to the culture (integrity)

Use “symbolic gestures” to reinforce and remind of the culture – ceremonies, storytelling, terminology, RECOGNITION – we can always do more of this

Other questions to ask post this session:

How are employees likely to act when the pressure is on and no one is watching? Why?

Do we have talent-management practices in place across the organisation that support our 10 PLUS 1? What do we need to do to make this happen?
