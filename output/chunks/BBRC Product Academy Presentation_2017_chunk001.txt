▪ Often we are to busy ‘doing it’ to think about what we ‘are doing’

or ‘should be doing’

▪ We never take enough time to ‘learn’ and apply the ‘learnings’

▪ Because BBRC is has multiple brands we can share learnings and

experiences

▪ At the end of today it would be a great outcome if you are more

able to do a good job

it’s about her, always!

▪ It’s about Her, always is misunderstood when it comes to product

– product is everything to do with the customer

▪ Product that the customer wants

▪ Meeting their needs to be:

➢ Individual, hot, glamorous, beautiful, noticed, ‘out there’, bold,

confident, trendy, daring, fashionable, rebellious, relaxed, spontaneous,

generous

➢ Healthy, clean, modern, noticed, trend setter, safe, role model:

─ As in wealthy, doing well, modern, environmental role model,

spiritual, etc. etc.

our product

▪ The name on the door is on the product

▪ We must be fast……… not necessarily perfect

▪ Our stores must be exciting for our customers – product is the main

driver

▪ What we (product team) do matters most – product is everything

▪ Product is the big differentiator and the number 1 driver of our

success

chief of product

So product is everything, then what role does the CEO of specialty

retail play?

▪ CEO is Head of Product

▪ Will be involved

▪ Must be involved

▪ Your role is to sell the reason for the product to the CEO

OUR MARKET

BBRC

16

what's our market + why?

▪ Mainstream retail: we MUST have success in the main market

▪ Don’t follow niche markets, sizing, trends – the “noisy minority”

» Dance

» Fringe sizes

» Clip on earrings

» Swim but not Sunglasses, beach towels,

» Brooches

» Clutch bags

» Festival

BBRC

remember her always

▪ Getting too far ahead/behind of our customer:

» Price

» Product

» Aspiration

▪ Ignore your own emotions, likes, needs and wants

▪ In the absence of being aware of this and checking in, we will drift

ahead/behind of our customer

we buy for our customer,

we don’t sell to our customer

“We buy for the customer, we don't sell to the

customer, I have learned that product developers,

buyers and retail organisations, including ours,

generally have trouble understanding this and I should

repeat it again and again.”

Brett Blundy

emotional connection

▪ Our customer does not ‘need’ anything we sell

▪ Our product must fill the ‘want’ and initiate an emotive reaction, we

must have product that connects emotionally:

newness + innovation

▪ Product is everywhere

▪ ….it has surrounded us

▪ Reinvention and change is a constant - new, different, fresh,

adapted and first…….

▪ But not too first as first can be a dangerous place

BBRC

28

finding newness + innovation

▪ Study your numbers – there are ‘gems’ in there

▪ Discover why something worked + adapt

▪ Talk to our team, customers, factories

▪ “I am always looking” – online, social media, magazines,

competitors, local shopping centres, what are people wearing and

doing?

▪ Fairs

▪ Overseas travel

▪ Immerse yourself in the ‘life’ of our category – Live it! Breathe it!

▪ Newness and Innovation also comes via new fabrication, materials

and technology (cheaper, better, stronger etc)

BBRC

29

finding newness

▪ Put your ideas into action immediately:

➢ Sign off or approval immediately

➢ Disregard your bad ideas quickly

➢ If appropriate go to the factory to get stuff started.

▪ Keep in mind you should pay for your trip by at least 10 times

through executed ideas

➢ If not, then do something different next time

BBRC

30

newness + innovation

▪ Planning for the next big thing:

➢ Evolution

➢ Revolution

➢ Reinvention

▪ When does a trend/fashion become the next norm?

➢ We want to be there

▪ Today’s fashion, tomorrow’s basics

▪ Fad vs. long term big market
