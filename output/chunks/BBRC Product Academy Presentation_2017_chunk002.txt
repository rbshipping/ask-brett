planning

▪ If one categories grows another category must shrink

▪ One in one out

▪ The overriding proviso is that all will change over time through new,

different, fresh and first

▪What's new, what's happening, what's tomorrow, what's exciting,

what's not, what do we go after, what do we leave alone?

new categories + our role in their creation

▪ Product extensions

▪ Lingerie accessories extensions successes and failures

▪ HB’s very existence comes from a new category

▪ Bodysuits

▪ Sterling Silver

▪ Body piercing

▪ Swarovski Elements

understanding “less is more”

▪ It’s too easy to fall into the trap of more and more product

▪ Depth and width of ranging – we tend to go too wide and too deep

(usually because we are unclear or unsure)

▪ Less is more

▪ Afraid to give something up

▪ Hang on to the last

▪ Belief that if we put in more options,

we sell more

BBRC

35

how do these work together?

We work our store space hard

High stock intensity

‘Less is more’

doing more with what we have

▪ Make big, BIGGER:

➢ More colours

➢ Sizes

➢ Create category

▪ See the gems that you can breathe life into –

make small big

▪ Examples:

➢ Wash bag

➢ Swarovski crystal studs

➢ Scented crystals

➢ Chokers - a piece of string

BBRC

37

doing more with what we have

▪ Launches – it’s important

» Why

» How

» When

▪ Retail team: our secret success for marketing and exciting our

customers

▪ If we are not ‘launching’ we are probably, at best, lacking

innovation and excitement for our customers and team and at

worst, not staying relevant

▪ Your role in this

testing

▪ We never do enough testing

▪Time

▪ Not pushing the boundaries

▪ Lack of confidence

▪ Testing is gold!

▪ Testing lifts your success and sell through % and GM$

▪ Always be testing:

▪ Drill down on the test results, for sales by grade and territory

▪ Learn from the results on both winners and losers

gold vein

▪We must hit gold veins regularly

▪When we hit that gold we mine for all it's worth

▪Speed and urgency

▪ When something is selling well you are often very close to a gold

vein

▪ When you have hit a gold vein – get onto the next one - don’t

become complacent

▪ Know when to ‘get out’

▪ Failure will follow if you don’t get going again

▪ Living on yesterday’s success

▪We often miss gold veins that are staring us in the face

TIPS TO KEEP IN MIND

BBRC

49

know your stuff

▪ Know your business well, be on top of all aspects of your product

role:

» Be interested

» Know what your product costs retail and margin

» Know the quantity you sell by week, “it’s a great seller” doesn’t mean

anything - YTD, final % sell through

» Know what your key sizes are, is the size range too wide / too narrow

» Know what's on order and the quantity

» Own your product from the “Cradle to the Grave”

» Study if you have to

» Be all over your KPI’s

▪ These are all signs of your commitment to and confidence in your
