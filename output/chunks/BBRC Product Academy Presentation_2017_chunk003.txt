▪ Listening to our customers/team is risky…

pricing + margin management

There is no secret formula on margin requirement – we price to

what the customer will buy

▪ We always want to maximise our margin, but not at the expense

of the customer (retail price)

▪ We must know our customer, market and business

▪ If we cannot make ‘the margin’ (at the right retail), then we

cannot range the product!

HOWEVER

▪ If the product is right we must range it!... but we don’t meet

minimum margin by putting the retail up

BBRC

52

margin management

▪ It’s not the first margin that matters, it’s the final margin

open to buy (OTB)

Why we have Open to Buy

each month
