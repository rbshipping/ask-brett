open to buy (OTB)

Why we have Open to Buy

▪ It tells us exactly how much we are allowed to spend on product

each month

▪ Is the key control to prevent us from being overstocked or

understocked

▪ It’s a blunt instrument that forces communication between

buyers, merchandise planners, finance and the CEO
