BBRC High Focus Topic seriesSuccession Planning

It’s about Her, Always!

February 2015

[Slide 2]

What is “Succession Planning”?

<number>

Introducing the “High Focus Topic” series (replacing the QMR)

However secure you may feel – there will always be turnover

In its simplest form, it is the process of knowing who will take someone’s job if they leave tomorrow… (including CEOs)

Meaningful Succession Planning can help mitigate disruption when it inevitably occurs

It has a broader purpose than it’s name suggests

Highlights opportunities to develop high potential individuals and skill gaps

If done properly, and over time, your businesses are more likely to “harness the internal knowledge” that is available, rather than look to outsiders (Bower, 2007) – cheaper and more effective outcomes

[Slide 3]

Why does it matter?

<number>

Being “mentally prepared” – reducing disruption when there is turnover

Protects our future

Helps identify who are the high performers adding value… and those who are not

Identifies development gaps (“X could do this job if they know how to…”)

Try and give successors more responsibility progressively, enabling testing of their suitability over a longer period of time (and reduced disruption)

Get team members performing “above” their job description… “held accountable to learn and to deliver” (Bower, 2007)

Can be used to highlight what behaviour leads to success and build culture

[Slide 4]

What is the process to use?

<number>

Keep it SIMPLE and REALISTIC

List out your direct reports, and their risk of leaving

Use the leadership gap template provided

Consider everyone…

High Performers

Ready to succeed

Potentials

Might fill the gaps

The Rest

May be performing acceptably in current role, but displaying limited potential

Continue to build their experience and keep them engaged (mentor)

Identify skills gaps – focus most of development time and effort here (develop)

Assess whether they have a future with the business – what value are they actually adding?

(up or out)

Continue to monitor and evaluate, e.g. are the “Potentials” moving up?

[Slide 5]

How to flow it through the organisation?

<number>

Ask your direct reports to do it for their teams and present it to you in the next month

Subsequently have it something that is reviewed every 6 months and put it in calendars automatically

The best successor may not be the most obvious direct report

This is not just an HR exercise

They can create tools and facilitate, but it is up to the business itself

[Slide 6]

Using the template…

<number>

Have this completed and be prepared to use it

List the most important roles that matter to your business

[Slide 7]

DISCUSSION

<number>

How prepared is your organisation to have Succession Planning in place? What challenges do you face?

[Slide 8]

Summary and next steps

<number>

Succession Planning is best practice and part of what we do at BBRC

It is valuable in minimising disruption in times of team turnover

It encourages a high performance culture and continuous improvement

All businesses should have plans in place which are reviewed on a 6 monthly basis

Please complete the CEO leadership gaps template and send it to me (if you haven’t already done so)

Ask your direct reports to complete them, and send them to you
