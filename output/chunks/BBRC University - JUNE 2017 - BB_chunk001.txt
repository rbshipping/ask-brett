How do we Combat the Complacency Curve?

First :We recognize and believe the issue is

real

Hard to do.

Second: Double down on our winning

culture.

It’s the antidote.

Get back to “Day 1” attitude.

➢ just getting started

➢ never arrived

➢ never satisfied

(hard to do when bonuses and applauses are continuous).

Regression towards the mean

Most all great business creations

regress over time to the average.

Why?

▪ Because the world is made up by ‘the average’.

- Average people

- Average outputs

- Average motivation

- Average focus, etc

▪ Mediocrity is constantly at work pulling us back to the average.

▪ Because we are human.

We exist to satisfy the customer and do everything in our power to

add value to the customer’s experience.

encouraged and every individual counts.

BBRC

4. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

We strive for excellence and are never satisfied – always raising

the bar to keep improving, even if it means changing

everything we do. We don’t get complacent and have never

arrived.

Communication is both directions – listening as well as talking.

Get communication going continuously and in as many ways

as you can.

BBRC

Costs are the enemy, we continuously find ways to reduce

expenses, cut our shrinkage, and improve our productivity.

Amazon

All great companies have

winning cultures that make

the difference.

“Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by

excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. And that is

why it is always Day 1.”

To be sure, this kind of decline would happen in extreme slow

motion. An established company might harvest Day 2 for

decades, but the final result would still come.

I’m interested in the question, how do you fend off Day 2? What

are the techniques and tactics? How do you keep the vitality of

Day 1, even inside a large organization?

Such a question can’t have a simple answer. There will be many

elements, multiple paths, and many traps. I don’t know the

whole answer, but I may know bits of it. Here’s a starter pack of

essentials for Day 1 defense: customer obsession, a skeptical

view of proxies, the eager adoption of external trends, and

high-velocity decision making.

True Customer Obsession

Amazon

There are many ways to center a business. You can be

competitor focused, you can be product focused, you can be

technology focused, you can be business model focused, and

there are more. But in my view, obsessive customer focus is by

far the most protective of Day 1 vitality.

BBRC

Amazon

Why? There are many advantages to a customer-centric

approach, but here’s the big one: customers are always

beautifully, wonderfully dissatisfied, even when they report

being happy and business is great. Even when they don’t yet

know it, customers want something better, and your desire to

delight customers will drive you to invent on their behalf. No

customer ever asked Amazon to create the Prime membership

program, but it sure turns out they wanted it, and I could give

you many such examples.

BBRC

Amazon

Staying in Day 1 requires you to experiment patiently, accept

failures, plant seeds, protect saplings, and double down when

you see customer delight. A customer-obsessed culture best

creates the conditions where all of that can happen.

Amazon

As companies get larger and more complex, there’s a tendency

to manage to proxies. This comes in many shapes and sizes, and

it’s dangerous, subtle, and very Day 2.

BBRC

Amazon

A common example is process as proxy. Good process serves

you so you can serve customers. But if you’re not watchful, the

process can become the thing. This can happen very easily in

large organizations. The process becomes the proxy for the

result you want. You stop looking at outcomes and just make

sure you’re doing the process right. Gulp. It’s not that rare to
