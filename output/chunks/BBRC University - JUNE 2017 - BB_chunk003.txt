ATTITUDE MINDSET

▪ We have never arrived.

▪ Its Day 1 – Day 1, always.

▪ There is no finish line – build for all time.

▪ We are starting from here – improve it.

▪ Its great – how do we make it better.

▪ If we are not improving we are going backwards.

Continuous improvement

Continuous improvement attitude and

mindset beats arrogance and

complacency.

Continuous Improvement

When we are winning convincingly we stop weeding the

garden. We stop paying attention. We are less focused. We

get more confident, more arrogant, more complacent …

and so does everybody around us. one way or another,

more or less everybody thinks they are experts.

This change is slow and subtle, most are not even aware it

is happening, it gathers speed slowly and consistently.

The weeds keep growing ...

We neglect the garden.

Henry Ford

None of our men are 'experts.’

We have most unfortunately found it necessary to get rid of a man

as soon as he thinks himself an expert because no one ever

considers himself expert if he really knows his job.

A man who knows a job sees so much more to be done than he has

done, that he is always pressing forward and never gives up an

instant of thought to how good and how efficient he is.

Thinking always ahead, thinking always of trying to do more,

brings a state of mind in which nothing is impossible. The moment

one gets into the 'expert' state of mind a great number of things

become impossible."

~ Henry Ford

Where are the weeds?

EVERYWHERE…

Why do weeds grow?

▪ Not knowing the difference between a weed and a flower.

▪ Bad attitude – arrogance, bureaucratic, we somehow think

we have beaten the weeds, we think we have become

experts and coast along.

▪ Arrogance is always FATAL – too smart for our own good.

▪ Day 2 – Attitude / Mentality sets in.

WEED GROW BY STEALTH

53

How do we know what a weed is?

▪ Waste.

▪ Arrogance (I am an expert)

▪ “Stupid Work”.

▪ Empire building.

▪ Complacency (no urgency).

▪ Good habits replaced with bad (and become the norm).

▪ CODB%

54

Do you need skills to identify problems (weeds)?

▪ Some jump up and bite you, most sneak up on you.

▪ Understanding and acceptance that – “ordinary” is lurking – that:

– waste

– inefficiencies

– attitude

– errors

seep in everyday.

▪ If I see 1 rat, I don’t have to see the other 10 rats to know they are there.

▪ Get beneath the “Surface”.

▪ Sanitize

▪ Complaints

▪ Walk around – ask questions – probe – listen

BBRC

55

Continuous improvement

▪ Keep asking, testing, probing - yourself and others

▪ Ask how we can do this faster, cheaper, another way?

▪ Ask why do we do that?

▪ Ask what are you doing and they why do we do it?

▪ Ask how does this work?

▪ See something working well and talk about it – spread the

news.

▪ See good people, ask how do we get more.

▪ See good product and ask how do we get more, how do we

grow it.

▪ Analyse mistakes or “the rebels” - sometimes there is

“gold”.
