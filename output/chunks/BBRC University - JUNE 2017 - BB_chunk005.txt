DEFINING CUSTOMER FOCUS

BBRC

BBRC

93

Define Customer Focus

▪ It’s about the customer always.

▪ Who is your customer – we all have them.

> Internal – External

> Awareness

> Reminders

“If you are not serving a customer or serving someone how is,

we probably don’t need you”.

BBRC

94

Define Customer Focus

It’s never about what

you are doing,

it’s about what you are

doing for the

customer.

CUSTOMER

SATISFACTION

CREW

SATISFACTION

Job satisfaction should be a by-product of putting the customer first,

not the reverse.

BBRC

96

Define Customer Focus

▪ Whenever we lose sight of the customer we slide backwards (it’s easy to do).

▪ Systems / Rules / Processes stand in the way of “Its About the Customer,

Always”.

▪ People issues overcome us.

▪ Budgets.

▪ What a product person personaly likes without reference to the Customer.

▪ Too busy to get out to the business.

▪ We got the stock to the stores 96% of the time. What about the 4% stores

managers and the Customers, how do they feel?

▪ Is the Department / Business / Area / Store is managing you? Or are you

managing it?

Define Customer Focus

▪ Don’t set people up to fail their customer.

▪ Dress code – is for the customer.

▪ When you strike gold mine – mine it – not for sales – for

the customer who wants it.

Example: BNT Personalization

▪ Remove the impediments that stop the team from being

able to do a good job.

Example: Diva’s GM conversation, Chaos vs Rhythm vs Customer

MOMENTS OF TRUTH

What’s the ideal reality in

that moment in time, did

we achieve it?

BBRC

104

Define Customer Focus

Good customer focus must

be created, educated and

repeated.

We must get into a rhythm…

We must support and

remind each other…

Culture is key – it needs protecting

▪ Have we put protections in?

▪ The right attitude, skills and in place to protect and grow.

▪ Are we measuring it? Testing / probing.

▪ Who’s on the lookout for danger?

▪ Where is our weakness that needs reinforcing?

▪ Proactive vs reactive

BBRC

If I see one rat…….

▪ If I see 1 rat, I don’t have to see the other

10 to know they are there.

▪ Fix 1 issue and 10 others connected will

improve – it’s exponential.

▪ Let 1 issue slip and 10 others will follow –

it’s exponential.

Examples:

• If there is 1 mistake in the numbers on the QBO report, there will be 10 other mistakes we haven’t

picked up.

• If 1 Balance Sheet reconciliation is not properly completed and cleared, there will be 10 others that

haven’t been properly completed.

• If 1 invoice is paid without proper authorisation, there will be 10 others that haven’t been

authorised.
