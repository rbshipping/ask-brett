Bras N Things

BNT Merchandise Planning

The rules and guidelines to operate within

For current and new team members

[Slide 2]

Apparel versus Intimates

Intimates doesn’t follow apparel methodology.  It is imperative that new team members understand the differences.

Short lifecycle, high markdown

More depth required by size

Less stock required to go all store

Less fragmentation

Fit is less of a concern

Fashion larger proportion of range

More price sensitive

Lots of competition

Customer needs less support

Higher planned markdowns

Less repeats

Not as seasonal

No need to clear at end of season

Best size in best bra = 1.1 per store per week

Up to 35 sizes, with low rate of sale

Fragmentation big issue

16 weeks of cover

If doesn’t fit, only price sensitive at rock bottom

Ongoing/core greater mix of range

No need to markdown, when can consolidate

Apparel

Intimates

Store Grading

BnT 2014

Stores graded on sales

A-D (best to worst)

Grading is done by department

Fashion Bras

Core Bras

Ongoing Bras

Regrades are done every season

Grade changes are only done by exception and can only affect replenishment (not cross dock)

Stores will be graded by sales and ideal stock holding and dept.

Issuing store fixture audit 03/03 to be completed 31/03

Grading complete 28/04 Christmas range to be bought to new grading

Establish ideal options by category/store group

Can more strategically utilize consolidation program to support:

Small stores with large turnover

Large stores large turnover
