[Slide 1]

GOOD TO GREAT – JIM COLLINS

Why some companies make the leap and others don’t

[Slide 2]

GOOD IS THE ENEMY OF GREAT

A period of growth or sustained success that far outpaced the market or industry average:- Gillette - Kimberley Clarke - Phillip Morris

Disciplined people

Disciplined thought

Disciplined action

[Slide 3]

LEADERSHIP

[Slide 4]

FIRST WHO THEN WHAT

Get the right people on the bus then decide where to drive it

A genius with a thousand helpers

Rigorous, not ruthless

CONFRONT THE BRUTAL FACTS (but never lose faith

Don’t be afraid to change direction

Lead with questions and not answers

Engage in dialogue and debate – not coercion

Conduct autopsies but don’t assign blame

Build red flag mechanisms so information cannot be ignored

[Slide 5]

THE HEDGEHOG CONCEPT

Simplicity within three circles

Determine what you are deeply passionate about

Determine what drives your economic engine

Determine what you can be best in the world at

Find your BHAG

A CULTURE OF DISCIPLINE

Determination

Freedom

Write “stop doing” lists rather than “to do lists”

[Slide 6]

TECHNOLOGY ACCELERATORS

Don’t jump on the bandwagon

Does the technology fit in the centre of your hedgehog concept?

Technology should accelerate momentum not create it

THE FLYWHEEL AND THE DOOM LOOP

Change may look revolutionary but it should feel organic

Sticking to hedgehog competencies initiates positive momentum

The doom loop is characterised by reactive decision making and extending into too many diverse areas

[Slide 7]

FROM GOOD TO GREAT TO BUILT TO LAST

Good to great is the starting point

Develop the foundations of greatness then focus on longevity

Good BHAGs v Bad BHAGs – understanding v bravado

THE FLYWHEEL AND THE DOOM LOOP

Change may look revolutionary but it should feel organic

Sticking to hedgehog competencies initiates positive momentum

The doom loop is characterised by reactive decision making and extending into too many diverse areas
