In time, your agile leadership team will come to focus considerably more on strategy and less on operations management.xx A greater focus on innovation, collaboration and strategy will help guide your company on how and when to pivot.

Generate Insights about Where to Pivot

In addition to cultivating the right types of teams and company culture that will allow your company to pivot, you must look externally to understand what types of pivots would be well received in the market. There are many ways to collect helpful insights on your customers’ needs and therefore find opportunities to serve them. You can analyze and then leverage the customer data your company already has. You can turn to the younger members of your organization, who are more likely to work on the frontlines in customer-facing roles, to gather their understanding of customers’ needs. Of course, you can also reach out to customers directly to ask how you can best help them through this challenging time. This is the time to practice customer intimacy, not only customer centricity.

Protect and Pivot=Exploit and Explore

Another way to think about “protecting and pivoting” is “exploiting and exploring”. Exploiting opportunities to make incremental improvements to existing operations while also exploring future possibilities for innovations and solutions is the hallmark of an ambidextrous organization. In an ambidextrous organization, new, exploratory units are separate from traditional, exploitative ones. This allows the new units to create processes and procedures that enable their creative goals. They are not beholden to the traditional way of doing things. Companies then compensate for this separation with integration at the senior management level, ensuring alignment at the top. As Charles A. O’Reilly III and Michael L. Tushman explain:

The structure of ambidextrous organizations allows cross-fertilization among units while preventing cross-contamination. The tight coordination at the managerial level enables the fledgling units to share important resources from the traditional units—cash, talent, expertise, customers, and so on—but the organizational separation ensures that the new units’ distinctive processes, structures, and cultures are not overwhelmed by the forces of “business as usual.” At the same time, the established units are shielded from the distractions of launching new businesses; they can continue to focus all their attention and energy on refining their operations, improving their products, and serving their customers.xxi

In order for an ambidextrous organization to be successful, ideally leaders themselves should be ambidextrous, meaning they can attend to the needs of different kinds of businesses. Also a key to success, leaders must consistently and clearly communication a vision for the company that allows exploitation and exploration to exist in harmony with one another.xxii The figure below for a summary of the different requirements of the two kinds of businesses found within an ambidextrous organization.

The COVID-19 outbreak has created a period of high stress for individuals and companies alike. It is also, however, an opportunity to examine current business practices in order to increase long-term operational efficiency and competitiveness, as well as to innovate for the sake of surviving now and thriving later. It is a time to protect the core business and pivot to new opportunities, or, in other words, to exploit and explore. To achieve your goals, consider leveraging cross-functional teams, employing creative exercises, adjusting expectations and deliverables, supporting an agile enterprise and generating customer insights. As Saenz and O’Keeffe claim, “Bold leadership teams are beginning to imagine this [post-pandemic] new world now and already adjusting their strategies and operating models. At this moment, teams want to hear four messages: our people are safe, our business is protected, we will recover stronger, and we will redefine the new world for our industry.”xxiii The gravity of the challenges facing businesses right now is not be to understated, but shifting perspective to see what opportunities are also presenting themselves will help companies to see another day and eventually adapt to the reality of the post-pandemic world, despite all its uncertainties.
