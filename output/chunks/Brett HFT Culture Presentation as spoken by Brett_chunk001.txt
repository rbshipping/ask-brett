Sustained, small and. Or even failing. It's to me the ingredient that matters and how we figure it out. That's why we're going to spend the time on this one. It is without doubt our competitive advantage. That's the way that I really think about this. Because we don't have very much in our world that's a moat. Or you can start a retail business. Almost. Hell, we've done it in this room. You can just get started. Luce, how did you get going? Remind everybody. Yeah. The most recent time. No. Way back when you were younger. 18. Right. You just. Can I remind everybody of my story? Right. I just started with a record story and the big monsters. Thanks, Joe. You'd probably get in trouble for losing the other one. Right. So there's no competitive advantage. That's the important part here.

There are very few we don't have. None of us in this room have a product advantage. We operate online. No advantage. Anybody can start online. Even more so just popping up. We even have AI coming. And one of the disadvantages we have of being large and busy, where somebody in their bedroom who's got this great idea and has got time to look at AI and start to play around with them, do the work. They're the serious competitors that we have in physical stores. We have to go and negotiate just like anybody else. Pay the rent, find us out. There's no moat and other industries do have moats. If you've got ip, you've got a moat. No one else can get close to you on that. So culture is what makes the difference.

And we have to ask ourselves, and what's the difference between success and superior results from a struggling chain? No question in my mind that it's the culture that we create and how we do it. It's everything. And that's the premise of why culture to me is so important. Why I'm going to spend the next 50 minutes talking about it. Not good. That's useless. Thanks, Joe. You're a good man. Thanks. So up here, because if I'm tough, I'm going to take 10 plus one. And maybe some people in this room might have been over time because we just need to better. And wherever we are on culture today, we can do better. It's complex in large organisations to keep consistency of culture going through.

Peter Drucker, for those of you know who he is, and he's one of my favorite guys because he's a thinker and he's been a creator of lots of business things that people use all the time. Culture eats strategy for breakfast. I think everybody knows that now. That can be debated. A lot of people do debate it and you can put it around the order. And some people are better at strategy and less so on culture, there's no question we can. You can mount intellectual arguments around it, but at the end of the day, for retail and for us, it's culture that matters. That doesn't mean strategy doesn't matter. Really important. We've got to get that right as well. And the reason I believe so strongly in that most retail failures aren't strategy failures, they're just culture execution.

They're not even operational execution, they're cultural focus, which leads into execution at all levels. So I wanted to talk about, just quickly remind why that matters. Best, unless Ray's actually left because he's on his way to New Zealand. Best and Less is an amazing story of two years from. From a business that was very ordinary to one that is now very strong and getting stronger. We haven't changed anything. The stores are still. It's a 60, Andrew, how old is the business? 65 years old. Stores look like they did two years ago. Sorry, that's not true, Joe. They look cleaner and crisper. But I'm talking about a set, the item variable that's changed. We haven't dramatically changed. Our product offering just came in here. And for those in the room of Best and most here, Ray changed the culture.

Would that be a fair summary? And for those in the room here that can help, you know that's all that's happened and the results have just quadrupled from where they were. Funny story. Andrew does his job, does all these graphs and charts. There is a ceiling there, a limit that Best and this could never, ever get over because it just can't. Because economically, that's not the most words. There's immersion of business and we have to do something better, break that cycle. And the next month we just blew that out of the water. Now Beeline is even more. Now, not everybody here knows Beeline. Lisa knows Beeline very well, but Beeline was talking about moats and cultures. Beeline sold what Lovisa sells, had access to the same thing, did a pretty good job at doing it.

Beeline had 150 stores and was dead broke to the point where they paid us 10, 15 million, I forgot 11 million euros. 11 million euros to take the business. Best deal that I've ever done in my entire life because it's turned out well and they paid us to take it over. Won't get into the retail. But the difference there. And at the time I said, without our culture, that would be Lovisa. And it's really important to understand no difference, same size stores, same way of presenting the product, same planogram issues, same factories, same everything. The difference is culture. And that goes to the heart of it. We take them over, turn them around and they're now contributing fabulously to Louisa's success. And was, believe it or not, the reason were able to springboard into Europe so strongly.
