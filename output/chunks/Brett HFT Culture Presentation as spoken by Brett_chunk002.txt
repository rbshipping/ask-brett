Because we took over four or five countries and away from it. Culture at every level, operational level, the way they presented, the way they showed up, their care factor, the cost base, what they didn't do in the support office, what they did do, all those sorts of things was the reason. So the important part is, in the absence of culture, Lovisa can end up being better very quickly and broke. In the absence of pressure, best and less can quickly go back to what it was. There is no change to anything. There is no magic to it. Our job is to do what is culturally right, to win what we have to do. And the reason this session is important is to figure out what that actually means. Because it's slightly different for every business. That's how critical it is.

And I know it sounds over dramatic to say that without a strong culture we will go broke. But I believe without a strong culture we will certainly decline and can go broken. There's a couple of examples of what happens. Culture drives performance more than any operational system. And this is what I want because we can debate this, we can strongly debate this. But I would really love everybody to take from this session that's what's more important. Now that doesn't mean that say that our operational. We desperately need good operational systems.

We definitely need to automate, we definitely need to make sure that we stay current, that we don't have systems that don't work and we don't have systems that don't work because they're old or we don't have systems that don't work because we're not operating them from a people and understanding point of view. For large scale retail, large scale, it is impossible to be everywhere. Therefore culture is absolutely a proxy for not being able. Have some pity on John. He's got 10,000, 40, whatever it is today, stores. Did I say 10,000? Give me a couple years. 1041. John cannot even possibly in his lifetime visit at all those stores. Nobody in this room would expect me to visit all those stores yet they have to all have the same culture. They have to have the same performance. They have to have the same performance.

But what will drive that more than any other process is the culture of how we deliver. Strong culture is our sustainable competitive advantage. Best in just to take that away. That's what I really want to continue doing. Part that it's culture, culture. I know you all know this, the CEOs in the room and the leaders in the room and the country managers in the room. Managing large scale retail businesses means you influence culture, not control operations, because you can't control the operations. Walmart. I once had the privilege of going to Walmart and the head of Walmart at the time was the largest company in the state, certainly still is the biggest, largest retailer in the world, but it's the largest company in the world. And he said, I've no idea how to run the largest company in the world.

S

12:22

Which is, first of all, even that alone was what. That's why you're the largest company in the world. Because the CEO wasn't trying to pretend that he could operate 3,000 stores in whatever it is, 30,000 stores, and they had at the time 2.4 million, 2.4 million team members. You can't possibly be on top of all that. But he said the culture of this place is that we figure out how to do this with one product and we figure out what to do with one person and we figure out what to do with one store and then we just get really good at making sure that happens across every store. And that's culture at work. It's their culture. Keep it simple. Arrogance and ego in politics kills culture. Driving culture is about mindset, an attitude bigger than the individual.

S

13:25

So that's where I start now to get into the cultural aspect. In order to get winning cultures, you cannot have egos and you can't have politics. And you've got to kill it. Wherever you see it is a stone dance. Stop. Because that just eats away at positive cultures. We all know this brutal maths. One bad store manager impacts hundreds of interactions, hundreds of customers. Yet we so often let one bad manager, one bad issue, we don't correct it. I like to think about this as our philosophy of how we do things. If we look and behave like everyone else, we will start being like everyone else. And everyone else is average. Now that sounds a bit egotistical, but the world is average. That's just what it is.

S

Speaker 1

14:30

You take the collectiveness of anything there is an average and most people, everyone performs to that Average, because that's why it's the average. But that means there's the overachievers and the underachievers. So we have to be different. Our culture has to be different. It can't be the same. And we, of course employ new people. One of the reasons why it's much better to promote from within is because when you've got a strong culture, you're pushing that up. When we bring people in from outside, we're bringing in the average. And it's rare to bring in something that is above average. So the force is against us. So we have to be different. We have to start with we are different. We have to be proud of being different, whether it's just simply in dress code or product design that we hold people more accountable.
