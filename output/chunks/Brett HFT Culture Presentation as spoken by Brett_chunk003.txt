That's the difference that we're talking about. Poor culture, inconsistent customer experience, declining sales, poor culture, inconsistent customer experience, then we're on our way out. That's how it happens. Okay, feel free to comment on this because I know that some of these things are controversial and I'm railroading everybody into. But argue. If you misunderstand or you don't want to believe it, or you have a different point of view, it's important. Did I say that much so that they now will or that was just. I think they get it. Me pretending I think they got it. Okay, framework, Are we all right so far? Jules has heard this like 20 times. This is great. It's back. Why the framework matters with you guys, senior leaders here, 10 plus one. It's got to be the essence of how we behave. There's variance on it all.

You put your own personality and your own mark on it. But it has to be the essence of how we behave. We have to be one. We have to be rowing together. We have to be like an orchestra that's working together. We're all playing a different part and different instruments bring different tempo and so on. But we have to be doing that with large scale retail businesses. These aren't just suggestions. They've got to be in our DNA. They have to be how we operate. No deviant. We have to kill it when we see it. Each one of these culture commitments, and this is the bit for large scale. Each one of these has to be what you commit to and that will allow it to scale across. I know I'm picking. I'm a visa. That's because you're the biggest.

I mean, how many team members do we. 7,000. 7,000. So this is the importance of this. In this Room here and perhaps across 30 leaders in Lovisa. We have to do it right so that it scales across 7,000 people. And that's the thing to understand why we have to stand for something, why we have to make sure that we talk about it more, that we're louder about it, because it loses as it pushes out. So we've got to continue to do that. Everyone's got to commit to me in this room, everybody here. We've got to model it. You also have to measure it. We've got to find out. And it's hard. Culture is really hard to measure, no question. But we've got to figure out how to feel it, how to measure it, and then we've got to multiply that all the way through.

You all with me? You good? Yeah. I don't even know what that is. Julia does all these fancy things for me. I looked at this last time and said, I don't understand that. So I can. It's too late. It's cool to get it out. Okay. I just want to run through. I hand it out. So I just want to quickly run through. Everyone's seen this. This is the BBRC one. You've got to personalise it if you want to. You can steal it if you want to and use it. But I just want to run through what it all means. Can do attitude. Distilling this down into a basic form where we can. We can live by it. We can get 7,000 team members in the visa case to broadly understand it and work towards it.

As long as we as leaders do tend to attitude. You've been inspired and achieved by your attitude and actions. What does that mean? Ambition and attitude trump skill. Ambition and attitude trump skill most of the time. Please don't take this literally. Right? If you. If Chris needs a tax expert, we've got to have someone that at least quite right. He's going, why? So maybe we got that wrong. Ambition and attitude trump skills. Hire and promote accordingly. That's just a. That's the only way we're going to get can do attitude to hire for attitude. Okay, how does that impact our scale? Attitude cascades through every level of leadership. We all know this. People with the right attitude and the right approach, it's just. It's what you need. It's not toxic. It's the opposite.

S

20:32

I don't even know what the opposite of toxic is, but it flows. Can do attitude. What is it say, yes, Ray's gone now, so if you haven't listened to his podcast, Ray's Number one secret to his success is just say yes. That's his. And for those of you know Ray, well, he just says yes. Except when he says no. And you listen to his podcast. That's some of the outrageous things that we asked him to do and he just said yes. And then he figured it out. Customer service and perfect service is critical. It's about the customer. Always she. I say she. I shouldn't say that because we have. Have he customers now, but I still can't help myself. She's the boss, she's in charge. If we're not serving her, if we're not subservient to her, then we've got the wrong attitude.
