We exist to satisfy the customer and do everything in our power to add value. That's got to be our mission. Full stop. That's our mission. That's our culture. If that's not our mission, change the person. We've got a lot of people that don't see it as a mission and we've got to create it as a mission. CEO reality. In retail, the customer relationship is everything. Every decision must pass that test. It's just, it's a bedrock. We've got to go, how does this help our customer? Even the AI thing that we're talking about, those things have to ultimately lead to us creating a better business that will better for the customer. Full stuff. Everyone with me. Respect. We treat everyone with respect and dignity. Little things that I learned a long time ago.

We don't call people staff, we don't have super visionary supervisory positions because it's just the wrong way to think about it. All ideas are encouraged and every individual counts. That doesn't mean that all ideas are implemented and accepted, but all ideas are encouraged. Thank you for that idea. Stupid one. Thank you for it. It's an important difference. Okay, Respect scales, it just does if you're respectful. It's just the way that it works. You all know that. And respect is either everywhere or it's nowhere. Wherever we have one failure point, we've got a complete failure point. We keep that gap. Continuous improvement. I think out of all these things, this is the easiest thing for everybody to understand because everyone almost thinks that's what they do automatically.

But it's actually, to me, one of the hardest to get into an organisation, to get it to flow down. So we've got to continuously strive for excellence. We've got to make sure that whatever we're doing, even if we think it's terrific or it's good, there's Always more to do. It also means changing continuously, even if that means changing everything that we do, because you have to stay relevant. We want to be the ones doing the leapfrog, not being leapfrogged from others. And in retail that happens and we've got to stay ahead. I think, John, you spoke about we missed the waterproof. We did. And you know, we're the largest in the damn world at doing this and we missed it. And because we're probably reluctant to take a risk and change. So we've got to do that. What I've learnt the executive.

This is a challenge for you and it's hard. And I've learned this, it's hard for me to do. The moment you celebrate, complacency creeps in and that stops the improvement from happening. Now, that doesn't mean you can't celebrate. You have to celebrate. You have to acknowledge group performance. But it's a tricky thing to understand. The moment you start to, oh, we're through. If you. Fantastic. You're great too. Everything's wonderful. You just slow up, you take your foot off the accelerator, you have the mindset changes and then you're not there anymore. Communicate, communicate. I want you to know that Stephen beats me up regularly. It's his job to beat. Beat me up. And I talk about this, I've been talking about it for 40 years, that we've got to communicate and do better.

And he constantly reminds me that sometimes I forget to communicate properly. So we aren't all good at these things, but we've got it. We've got to keep at it and keep at it. Communicate, both directions. Communicate up, we've got to communicate down. We've got to listen as well as talk. That's another thing that Stephen remarked. I'm getting all nervous now. Communication's got to work to keep it going. That's why it was so impressive I started this morning that the two of you guys did something in lunch six months ago, or whatever it was, that's turned out so positive. These meetings are a way of getting communication going around the table and so on. You can't run big businesses without clear and continuous communication about the mission, about what's happening, what the changes are. Everyone has to know what is expected.

It's not their fault, it's not their responsibility. If they didn't know what were trying to achieve and you left them out there to run their own show. And then we wonder why something didn't happen. Critically important costs. We all get that cost of the enemy. Continuously find ways to reduce our expenses. We forget it so often, it's almost like an afterthought sometimes. And the more successful that we are, the more that we go, oh, it's okay. We have to look for waste, we have to take out the garbage, we have to weed the garden and we have to have regular reminders of how we do that because it can just fall off the radar and then you go, oops. We have to continuously find ways. Now, technology is helping with cost for sure, but there are different ways to do it.
