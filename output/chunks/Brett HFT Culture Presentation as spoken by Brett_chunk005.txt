I think we've said this three times already today, but if cost of doing business as a percentage of sales is going up, you're doing something wrong. You just got to face that brutal fact. That's what's happening. And you've got to find a solution for it. Because costs are the end. Accountability. We all stumble on this from time to time. Commit, take ownership, be responsible for your actions and the results. We in this room have to. There isn't. If we're winning, you can take, you shouldn't. You can quietly go, okay, I probably had something to do with that. But you've got to just share that around. But if we're not winning in some area, wherever there's a problem or an issue, it has to start with. It just has to start with you. And that's the only way to tackle these things.

Do or do not. There is no try. It's a mindset thing a around accountability. Find yourself saying, I'll try or I'll try. That's the wrong way to approach it. Okay, Leadership standard. You cannot hold others accountable if you're not accountable yourself. You all get that, right? So pick yourself up whenever you find you're not being accountable to yourself because you won't have an account. Cannibal organization. Teamwork. We can't run retail without teamwork. We can't run teamwork. It's just impossible. We can't have a whole lot of a players. We want a players, but we want them to work as a team, together, supporting each other, depending on each other. It's the only way that it works. And it's a better environment. Does everyone agree that when you've got good teamwork, it's a better environment?

You want to show up for work, you just want to hang around. There isn't everyone bolting out the door at five o'. Clock. And we succeed through the efforts of our team. John just said 7,000 people. Unless every one of those 7,000 is doing their Job and feeling good about themselves, we're in trouble. Retail truth. No individual can manage large scale retail businesses. You just can't do it right. Teamwork is survival. Large scale, you can do it. I've been small and big. When you're small, you know everybody. You can do everything as you scale. You've got to make sure that we are teams delivering 10. What have you denied? Trust. Always act in a way and a manner that instills trust in all our team. We have to add in customers here, suppliers and the community. Without trust, we're gone. Trust is your currency.

Once lost, nearly impossible to rebuild at scale. So we've got to be very sensitive to that trust, transparency, honesty, sharing, all those things are critically important. 10. Integrity. Operate with honesty and integrity. Never tolerate a breach of integrity. So we have to operate the way that we expect everybody to operate, in line with our culture. And then we can't tolerate because the moment we tolerate something or let something go, we've said, we've rewritten the rules, we don't have any integrity then. And we have a lot of stuff coming at us all the time and a lot of decisions we're making continuously and the ways we behave and how we show up. There's a ton of pressure on all of us in this room. One integrity failure can destroy years of reputation, which is a terrible thing about human nature.

You can do so many things right continuously and then one little slip and everybody, all of us in this room, which is a huge pressure again. Whenever you walk into a store or you're in the office, everything you say and do is being watched. You may not think that's happening, that's what's happening. We all have that. And then you do one stupid thing and it's tough. 10 plus 1. Do it now. We all in this room have to build a culture that is about now. Urgency. We have to make decisions, we have to take action. We have to get the things done. But of course, we have to get the right things done. Decisions. Everything we do, we've got to deal with that true sense of urgency. That's the only way retail wins. We have to stay in front. It's tactical.

Our business is continuous, so we can't take days or weeks to make decisions. Insight. A quick decision. This is really important and crazy. I believe it's so true. A quick decision, even the wrong decision is better than no decision. Now that's sort of a. It can be. But when you get that right, even the wrong decision is better than no decision. Particularly in retail. And then just to confuse everybody even more. Indecision is a decision. If you can't make a decision, that's actually a decision and we can't. When I'm mentoring anybody, it's like, you've got to make, you got to stand for something, you've got to make that decision, got to do it. Now, the truth is that in retail, if you make a decision and it's the wrong decision, you can change it back.
