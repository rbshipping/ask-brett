So you have to be able to recognise it was the wrong decision. That's the beauty of moving fast, making quick decisions. You always have to know, be mature enough to be able to go, oh, got that wrong. And you can change it back. In many of the tactical decisions that we make. Okay, that was a quick run through on. Just a reminder, that's the sheet that got there. I know that Lovisa incorporates this in their own. It's word for word in Lovisa, which I appreciate. Of course, BVRC offers runs by because they have to. So away we go. So I wanted now to just move into some of the ways in which, through that, through our words and our action and the way that we behave, to be able to just give a bit more meat on the bone.

So I already said culture eat strategy for breakfast. There aren't any KPIs that you can really strongly measure. It drives everything, but you don't see it. It's not there in a physical sense. So you have to learn it, you have to be able to feel it. And I would urge everybody to spend time in that. I believe everybody in this room will know good or bad culture instinctively when that's the case. It's what really drives culture. Winning or losing or improving it or letting it fall back is what you choose to do in that moment when you see good or bad. And that's conflicts because in big organisations you can't fix it yourself immediately. You let it go all the way through to wandering the DC and there's rubbish that you step over instead of picking that up.

These are everything from really complex culture decisions all the way down to just what you do. You show up. We are the culture teams are watching us all the time. Your communication style, who you are, your personality, it just flows through and it has to be aware of that. That means we'll all don't be aware of it, to the fact you do and say nothing. That's what happens. Everybody agree with that? It matters. Words and actions create culture at scale. I just want to put a few of These down here for everyone to just keep understanding that what we do matters. Action words that drive execution, decision words that create momentum, Accountability words that are still establish ownership. Problem solving words that focus on solutions. That's the attitude and culture that we need. Action words, decision words, accountability words, problem solving words.

And then there's a reverse of that and we've got to be conscious of these things and we've got to do more of the right thing and less of this one. So it's just the reverse. Delaying words, excuse words, vague words. One of my unbelievably most frustrating things to do. Particularly when I sit in board meetings and some leaders come and present and I'll go, I have no idea what he's saying. And I think I'm a pretty good retailer because they're just trying to say stuff that sounds good and seems to have action words in it, but there's nothing going on. And this is whole lot of vague words because they don't want to be held accountable. They don't want to actually say something because they might be held accountable for. And it just frustrates the hell out of me.

And meaning words, they're all things that we have to instinctively know. Pull up ourselves when we're doing the wrong thing. Help each other, support. Support each other when you see it, we can do that in order to make sure that we are building our culture and not pulling it down. Because there's enough people pulling our culture down constantly. We don't need to do it ourselves. Yes, you will get a copy of all this. Words and actions create culture at scale. Walking the floor. Here's what I believe, what I have learnt. When you're out and about in the DCs, in the stores, walking the office, sitting at other people's desks, asking them what they're doing, why they're doing, how they're doing. Can I help you? You know, do it versus staying in your office, making decisions in meetings then and there instead of deferring it.

We'll come back to that, we'll think about that. Not sure, we'll have to go and check that. Decisions. It comes back to make a decision. Any decision making the wrong decision is better than no decision following through publicly. You know that old thing about praise publicly and condemn people privately? Same thing. Don't do it when you're trying to do culture things, do them publicly, do them symbolically in front of everyone. Immediate recognition delayed feedback. Good job. Instead of waiting, get it done. These are all things that determine our culture and the Winning culture, direct culture violations means deal with it straight away, then and there. Now that's not always easy. And there's a particularly at scale. There's an ordering and interfering and there's a number of complexities to all this.
