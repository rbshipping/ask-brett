I'm not in any way saying this is easy thing to do, just saying that it's the important thing to do. But definitely you cannot ignore the issues, the challenges, the problems, the culture violations, broad communication, spray it out broadly, don't keep it silent. You can never over communicate. Right, Stephen? Even if you end up sending the wrong thing to people that have no interest in it from you guys, they'll feel privileged that they've got it. As long as it's not an email that shouldn't have went somewhere. That's the way to think about that. Are you with me? Yeah. Anybody? Stephen, you want to debate any of this? Not publicly. Maybe later. If it was privately, what would you do? If we're on my one one with you, what would we.

I think we've been working on extreme communication as an idea to push us to go further with this. As you said, it sounds easy, but it's a behaviour. And so I know in our agenda every week, it's extreme communication as an agenda item. So I go, if were going to do extreme communication, what would that look like? And then you go, well, what would that look like? And that's when you sort of. It's just a prompt that we have as a discipline. So all these things require a discipline to put into practice. And so we practice every week. It's an agenda item. Yes, we do. So you're agreeing with me? I'm agreeing with you. Okay. Anybody disagree with any of those? And you're allowed to. This is. This is complex.

And I tried to distill a winning culture down to, you know, 10 plus one page. Even that in itself is bound to be wrong in certain situations. I think reflection about making decisions. There's no way Melissa would have grown at the rapid rate it did without the ability to make quick decisions. Well informed, but quick, fast decision. There's always 100% people in the room that'll tell you can't open that new country or open 10 stores in November or December. But just having that sort of fearlessness and also the ability to just make decisions, to make it happen. Super important. Yeah. And sometimes that's the winning edge. The Visa's winning edge is just getting there faster. So speed and urgency is part of our culture.

S

44:46

Of course, the reason I ask for this debate is because if you're making fast decisions, but every one of them is wrong and the business is broke, but you go, at least I made quick decisions. All these things have an element of course, fast decisions and the correct decisions answer to a winning culture. I'm hoping everybody in this room gets the intention of what we're talking about here and knows how important it is to get on and get it done. Okay, I'm repeating myself here. Just to bring it together, I'm reading this right now. Steven's going to kill me. I don't want any CEO that needs a week to decide. Could have phrased that better, I think. You know, you've said that before. Privately, they no longer. But the reason for that is again, large scale retail, delayed decisions.

S

Speaker 1

46:07

And that's your point that you're making there. Delayed decisions are exponentially costly because retail is fast. It's tactical. We've got to move in that as well though fast decisions doesn't mean you have to make big decisions. Test and learn is a huge part of successful culture. We want to have lots of ideas, we want to make decisions, but let's test them, let's learn from them. The whole thing is never bet that far because make a quick decision, that's huge, that might send us broke. Okay, well that's a good idea. Let's get it started tomorrow. But do it in one store or 10 stores and it, as I said, it proves that if you get it wrong, change it back. That's part of being fast. Ship got that wrong. The organization can just turn it around. Sacred.

S

47:09

So I actually sacred is a big word, but I actually think that it is sacred culture. And we have to make sure that we get that across to everybody that these are things that are sacred in this organisation. Because remember, culture comes from the word cult. So these are strong words. And it is a sort of a cult that we have. So we do need to preach it, we need to protect it, we need to talk it, we need to do all of this stuff, nurture it. We cannot violate any of it at any time. Or if we see a violation, then it needs to be corrected quickly. The culture commitments needs to. Here's where the rubber meets. No, it needs to sit above the urgent, above priority, above the day to day.

S

Speaker 1

48:20

So when we're faced with these things, it has to be the thing that matters most. Even if it's not seen to be the most urgent, it's the most important. That's the mindset in order to determine what your culture is going to be. Then you need to drive. It needs to be escalated. Above everything, I think these things are sacred. Our customer culture. This is the way to think about it. Customer, customer. Nothing comes before the customer. Liaise. Had a particular issue that I want to share with you. That is really difficult in this world today, around the customer versus the team, the people, the customer first team is our most important asset. Culture helps us do all of this, develop them, train them, motivate them, et cetera.
