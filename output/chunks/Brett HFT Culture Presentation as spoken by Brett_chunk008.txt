The first time visited Lee, a store, very proudly, I go to visit Werribee and we've got an unfortunate team member who's got a huge body odour issue. And that's tough in this world. How do you manage the body odour issue? And it's doubly more important, doubly more offensive in a fitting room environment, in lingerie, where team members get in the fitting room with them and fit so it is very close, it's very intimate, and then body odour becomes overwhelming. Two months later, that team member is still in our store. Now, Mark and I have a debate over all this, but I'm using this as a example. But we didn't make the decisions fast enough because our culture wasn't there that said customer, customer, ahead of team, team. Because there is absolutely times where there's a clash.

And when you refer back to the culture, who wins? What are we going to do? What's the right answer here? And then sacred pillar is product. Our culture is. We have to do it right, we have to have the right price, we have the freshness. We just. We're obsessed by this now. It's a business function, it's taught, but we have to culturise it. And that's what we partly do. Part of the reason why we insist to put everybody through the imagery academies all the time, because it's cultural. You just got to sit through it and do it. We teach it because it's become cultural as opposed to just a standard of the way that we do it. And that's the difference.

When you take something that everybody does, but you apply a culture around it that's different, and that then turns to something that we are different about it and we're known for a winning culture that is positive and distinctly recognisable. That's one way to think, have we got something special going on? It's one way for all of you to measure where you think, have we got something that's distinctly recognisable? And that means that sometimes other people in the industry know that's how we behave. Or even say, don't go to XYZ because of that. That might not certainly be the right reason, but to understand it and Luce, you and your team have built a culture that is very distinctive and the market knows it. And I'm not just talking about a brand way. We've got to close those blinds because that sun is.

Can somebody sort that out? Our duty in this room is to protect what is sacred, right? The word sacred, you got to protect. Sacred, you've got to protect. And strong words, I know, but that's why I want you to think about it. You gotta protect it from people who steal or are trying to pull it down. You gotta protect it. Bad hires, unnecessary admin. These are all cultural things. Be prepared. Spend some time on protecting it, making sure it's there, checking up on it. Important. You're with me on that. Protect it. It's so important. Everybody in this room have two functions. One, you continuously be the architect. Now I don't want it to be changed a lot and I protect that myself. But we've got to be every day trying to continuously improve.

Not just the ones that are delivering it and setting the pace on it and setting the standard on it, but you also have to be the architect of it. CEO should never be part of the drama. You have to set the tone and be above it because a lot of drama goes on in to stay above it. You can't pull yourself down into it as being accountable to our culture. How your daily choices create or destroy culture across large scale retail. I mean, this is heavy stuff, right? It's not meant to be. We're supposed to enjoy our jobs. But just remember everything you do and say and how you show up and appear and the whole spectrum is really important. You know, there are so many things.

When I was learning about culture in my early days, I went across to a retail event years ago and the guys told me a story about how strong culture is and how it can be applied. The two brothers that they were in the sports thing in New York, Models, I think it was called. And they decided that they were too casual because of sports. So the two brothers, the founders who worked in the business decided without telling anybody that they would start to wear. They started wearing ties to work every day and they tracked it. It was three months before all the senior team goes in the office. Males were wearing ties and they didn't say a word. They just started wearing ties. That's Actually culture in action, the multiplication effect. Your behaviour influences managers who influence thousands.

So everybody's influencing everybody. But it starts with us. We all good on that. We all know that's our gig. And this is just a reminder, okay? Be part of the solution and have a part of the problem. Culture spreads through modelling and reinforcement at the top. No question. That's your responsibility. You don't just hire for attitude and train for skills. You must embody both of those. Building through consistency, leadership, behaviour. So that's another cultural aspect. We have to be consistent, which is sometimes challenged to do because you can judge people differently. We can have favourites, we can have good days, we can have bad days. You have to go, sometimes I laugh at my day. I have to go from one call to the next. And we all have to do this.
