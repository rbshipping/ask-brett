And one call can be having a friggin fight with somebody and then you're going to a celebration of what you're getting out of the trophy. Right. It's just. And we've got to shift, we have to do that. It's just, it's constant. It's constant. Do we all agree with that? I don't know. Is that just a me thing where you can. Yeah, just up and down. It's crazy sometimes. Okay. Commitment. We are building success and superior results, not just managing stores. And that's. We've got to get that all the way down our departments, our country managers, our regionals, all the way through. Culture as your only sustainable competitive advantage. I know I started with that, but I'm going to finish with that. It's the only competitive advantage that we have. That's how come it's important. Culture really is everything.

The customer obsession scales or it fails based on your leadership. True. Have I convinced you? Yeah. Yes. Well, haven't finished yet. Okay. The anchor. I'm feeling too much here. Here's the challenge for you guys. Embrace the 10 plus one. Now I know many of you are going to say I do, I know it. But this is a reminder or a pressure not just as the way that we speak about it, but as the way we set the strategic framework for the business. Incorporated into the thinking about be the leaders that others want to emulate when it comes to culture and supporting the culture, walking the culture, talking the culture.

And the end result really the pinnacle is that if you create, which by the way never happens but you've got to aim for, create a culture that is so strong that it just continues to run itself. That's what we should all aim for. The Culture that I try to create for myself is that my job is to do myself out of a job. And I believe that's a cultural thing for me, not just a mission. My job is to do myself out of a job just to help everybody develop so that I'm not in what I need the ultimate question. When you're not in the room, when you're not in that store, when you're not on that call, what's going on? And if you do culture really well, the answer is that it's all good and it's all the way that you want it.

You've got to ask, does the culture that we have, is it delivering? Is it still delivering? Does your standard still hold when you're not there? You also want to be able to try to find ways to find that out and measure it. And if it's going on when you're not there at the level that you want it, then you're one. All right, gang, that's my culture. Who's got questions on it? Have I convinced you that we need to double down on it? Stephen? When I think of culture or I just think of relationships, in my world, it's about alignment. Ultimately, it's alignment, and a relationship fails when you're not aligned. And this idea of, what would Brett do? What's going to be aligned? Maybe my job's not that hard. I just. I'd look at this.

If you ask Brett, you just look at this and go, what would I tell that person to get in line with Brett? They say, would Brett like this? I just look at this, and that's it. It's not that much more complicated. Two things on that. One, I don't. I don't like the idea that what would Brett do? What would BBRC culture do? What would BBRC do? What's the right cultural decision here? And then what you're speaking to is values, right? What we're looking for. Also in order to have culture, which is we've got to push the culture down so that we're employing people with the same values, because not everybody wants to live to this 10 plus one. They don't. And we shouldn't expect everybody to want to live to that 10 +1.

01:02:12

But in order to have the culture that drives our success, we need to not bring those people on. Or if we find those people that aren't aligned, then we got to find ways to get rid of them, because they will sooner or later bring it down, and we have to be conscious of that. But it's not just us being conscious, we have to send that message out repeatedly. So that somebody being employed right now in the Netherlands having conversations in languages that probably nobody in this room even speaks, that we're getting that same values being brought in. That's the important part. It's the consistency of the DNA is not compromised. I mean, that is non negotiable. And then it's ensuring the consistency permeates through the organization full stop.

01:03:09

And it's that much harder when you have somewhat decentralized businesses and when you have 7,000 employees, markets, 14 countries. But when it is a non negotiable, it's a non negotiable. And John, even that's a cultural thing. Non negotiable. Because you can. I've seen times in our organisation where we proudly say this is non negotiable, yet the very time there's a violation of that non negotiable, we allow it, then we just rewrote the culture, we rewrote the rules. And so consistency in delivering that, no, that's not acceptable culturally. Sometimes it's not cultural, it's just rules. But rules form. The way to build strong cultures is start with rules and then those rules eventually become the way it is around here, the way we behave. But they start with rules. No, we don't do that.
