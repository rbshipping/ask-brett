the financial resources. Frequently, this problem surfaces after a private equity buyout has been

achieved in a particular retailer. After a buyout, of course, the first call on the cash flow of a

retailer is the interest on the debt--not fixing the place or website or the product or better service or

more advertising and so on.

The pentagon’s corners are easy to see and to understand. But, for most retailers, it is difficult to

execute on those corners in such a way as to build a really sustainable competitive advantage.

And, once set on a particular corner of the pentagon, the bottom line focus most retailers have on

ROI tends to insure a sort of negative inertia toward change.

Often, it is new players who invent or develop new sources of competitive advantage in retailing.

Frequently the incumbents are reluctant to change because they have made an investment in the

present. The new players may come from many backgrounds. Sometimes the new players are

former “losers” who have learned something--Sol Price at Fed-Mart and then Price Company

comes to mind. Or, maybe they left a winner, such as the founders of Costco, former senior

managers at Price Company. Sometimes they are “brand new” entrepreneurs, Build-a-Bear, for

example. Sam Walton was a successful Ben Franklin franchisee who tried for years to get Ben

Franklin to commit to discounting in small towns. Finally, when Franklin would not support the

concept, he did it himself. Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank were fired from Handy Dan Home

Improvement Centers and went on to invent The Home Depot. TJX grew out of Zayre, and so

forth. Amazon.com has transformed the industry, starting with books, and then moving on to other

categories, by bringing retailing to the internet

The Triangle

The pentagon has to do with all of those things a retailer does that the customer can see—the

customer facing activities. Behind the scenes, however, often not seen at all by the customer, are

the elements of the triangle. The elements of the triangle support the pentagon and, for the most

part, working hard on each of the elements of the triangle is the way retailers reduce their costs.

Reducing costs through better programmed supply relationships, better logistics, and better

systems.

It is the pentagon that drives the top line (high sales per square foot), but it is the triangle that

drives the bottom line (high profit per square foot.)

Systems

Systems provide the mechanisms for controlling flows and operations. They are carriers for

operational decisions and business processes. The information they supply can provide

competitive advantage if timely action can be taken. Increasingly retailers need systems that allow

them to manage item by item, store by store, and online.

Logistics

This corner of the triangle concerns the movement of goods from suppliers to stores and

encompasses distribution centers, online warehouses, and transportation. It is a major factor in

operations and financial performance that relates time and inventory (turns). In many retail supply

chains there exist significant opportunities to reduce loss from theft, breakage, spoilage, intentional

fraud, and unintentional inaccuracies.

Suppliers

Supply relationships determine deals, terms, delivery quantities, and dates, etc. Relationships

range from adversarial to cooperative.

Triangle Activities

The many triangle activities can also be categorized as quick response, replacement of labor by

technology, and merchandising and space management.

Quick Response (including automatic replenishment) includes an alphabet soup of activities such

as EDI; UPC/Barcode; POS; CL; PSS; VMI; Perpetual Inventory; Programmed Supply

Relationships; and Information Sharing.

Replacement of Labor by Technology includes Front End Scanning; Labor Scheduling Systems;

Electronic Shelf Stickers; Fully Automated Warehouse/Distribution Center; Check Robot;

Automated Picking Lines; Store Security Systems; Environmental Controls.

Merchandising and Space Management includes SKU Data Capture; Direct Product Profitability;

Rapid Intensification and Delisting; and Modularization in Store Design.

In general, the idea is to build a productivity loop--to make an investment in lowering costs by

having better logistics, or better supplier relationships, or just in time delivery, or systems for better

inventory control or better labor scheduling, or whatever. Once costs have been lowered, the

company can then reduce its margins. Lower margins mean lower prices, and lower prices means

the company’s value equation improves. An improved value position results in higher sales per

square foot. Higher sales per square foot mean lower costs--as a percent of sales. And lower

costs means that retailer can reduce gross margins, and thereby prices, again.

The ultimate objective of working the triangle is to develop sustainable price leadership.

Companies who are most successful at this typically are or move towards consistent (or EDLP-

everyday low prices), rather than high/low promotional pricing.
