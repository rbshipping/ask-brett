Suppliers

Supply relationships determine deals, terms, delivery quantities, and dates, etc. Relationships

range from adversarial to cooperative.

Triangle Activities

The many triangle activities can also be categorized as quick response, replacement of labor by

technology, and merchandising and space management.

Quick Response (including automatic replenishment) includes an alphabet soup of activities such

as EDI; UPC/Barcode; POS; CL; PSS; VMI; Perpetual Inventory; Programmed Supply

Relationships; and Information Sharing.

Replacement of Labor by Technology includes Front End Scanning; Labor Scheduling Systems;

Electronic Shelf Stickers; Fully Automated Warehouse/Distribution Center; Check Robot:

Automated Picking Lines; Store Security Systems; Environmental Controls.

Merchandising and Space Management includes SKU Data Capture; Direct Product Profitability;

Rapid Intensification and Delisting; and Modularization in Store Design.

In general, the idea is to build a productivity loop--to make an investment in lowering costs by

having better logistics, or better supplier relationships, or just in time delivery, or systems for better

inventory control or better labor scheduling, or whatever. Once costs have been lowered, the

company can then reduce its margins. Lower margins mean lower prices, and lower prices means

the company's value equation improves. An improved value position results in higher sales per

square foot. Higher sales per square foot mean lower costs--as a percent of sales. And lower

costs means that retailer can reduce gross margins, and thereby prices, again.

The ultimate objective of working the triangle is to develop sustainable price leadership.

Companies who are most successful at this typically are or move towards consistent (or EDLP-

everyday low prices), rather than high/low promotional pricing.
