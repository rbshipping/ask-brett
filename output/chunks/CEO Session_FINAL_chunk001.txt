[Slide 2]

CEO Session

Wednesday 15 February 2012

[Slide 3]

Three Things You Should Never Do:

New store opening discounts

Stuff around with sale colours.  Sale is red and white - never anything different

Move clearance to the back of the store.  Markdown and clearance stays at the front of the store and always goes forward never back

2

[Slide 4]

It’s about the customer, always!

“Sorry I can’t sell you that, we’re stocktaking”

“… Because the customers come in”

“I felt like I was intruding in their space”

3

[Slide 5]

Your Role as CEO

If we want to avoid being crushed by our competition, you need to out think, out plan, out work and out execute them…  52 weeks a year.

That’s an ongoing commitment you have to make to the strategy and tactics to win at retail.

4

[Slide 6]

Sustainable competitive advantage comes from three things:

Competence and attitude of our people

Speed in which we execute our strategies

A winning culture – build a winning culture and great teams will follow

5

[Slide 7]

Standards and disciplines

Whatever you decide to do, enforce and motivate to that end – no matter what the short term cost

6

[Slide 8]

Excellence

Excellence is good business

Excellence is good for the team

7

[Slide 9]

If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it

What are you measuring?

What should you measure?

8

[Slide 10]

Be Humble

Arrogance and complacency are the most lethal enemies of strong:

Businesses

Brands

People

Products

Processes

Cultures

Everything

9

[Slide 11]

Get out of your office

Why do we spend time in the stores, DC, China, etc?

What is the purpose?

What is the tactic?

What is the benefit?

10

[Slide 12]

Being Mentally Prepared

Are you prepared for what you don’t expect to happen??

11

[Slide 13]

K.I.S.S.

Remove the impediments that get in the way of our team being able to do a good job…  Simplify everything, keep it simple

12

[Slide 14]

K.I.S.S.

The best ideas are the simplest ones; don’t let people complicate your business, because they will

13

[Slide 15]

Stay Focussed on the Outcome

Don’t let systems get in the way of doing business

14

[Slide 16]

Have Fun

Slave for a day

National PJ day

The Human Washbag

Frostie

15

[Slide 17]

Showing Up

It’s more important to be on board at the times people don’t expect you to be – Saturday, Sunday, etc

16

[Slide 18]

Promote/Judge Early

You can always promote before people are ready if their attitude and willingness is right.

This is even more so at middle and junior positions

The importance of terminating poor performers and the effect that has on the rest of the team.

17

[Slide 19]

Be on Top of Your Business

Know your numbers

18

[Slide 20]

Culture of continuous improvement…

Never let people think they have made it, find the next challenge.

19

[Slide 21]

Culture of continuous improvement…

Learning from doing…

Continuous improvement

20

[Slide 22]

Culture of continuous improvement…

It’s okay to try something new and fail - so long as you react quickly and learn from it

But… don’t bet the farm

21

[Slide 23]

Customer Concerns

CEOs take the initial call/review the e-mail when we receive customer concern?

A customer does us a huge favour by making a complaint and as long as we don’t get defensive, we fix the issue immediately.

We take the customers, side and then we address the issue, the issue can be an individual team member, a process, or procedure

22

[Slide 24]

Customer Concerns

Are we listening and acting?

People, process and approach

How deep and wide?

Actions to:

Fix

Improve

Change

23

[Slide 25]

Stuff that doesn’t work

My view on ‘stuff’ that should add value but doesn’t

Team Incentives

Lower level bonuses

Rewarding retention

Budgeting

HR

Focus groups

Dotted line reporting

24

[Slide 26]

The Role of the Support Centre

25

In your and your brand’s success

Who runs who?

Who supports who?

DC’s, China, retail - they need your protection

[Slide 27]

Communication

Get everyone talking

Communicate, Communicate, Communicate

26

[Slide 28]

Success never happens because we hope or wish it will.  It happens because we decide what should happen, what needs to change, what our culture needs to be and what people need to be and then we need to get out and communicate, communicate, communicate any way that you can and as frequently as you can in words and in actions.

Don Soderquist

Communicate! Communicate! Communicate!

27

[Slide 29]

Communicate

Your message

Your influence

28

[Slide 30]

Communicate! Communicate! Communicate!

Communicate:

Formally

Informally

Verbally

Written

In groups

One on one

Symbolic

In your every action

29

[Slide 31]

When I’ve told ‘em once, I’ll tells ‘em again and when I’ve told ‘em again, I’ll tells ‘em one more time.  And when I’ve told ‘em one more time, I find a way to tell ‘em again.

30

Communicate! Communicate! Communicate!

[Slide 32]

Communication

Communication is greatly aided by obsessive paranoia.  Fear that the message isn’t getting out.

Communication is greatly assisted by an enthusiastic delivery.

Communication is greatly assisted when the leaders are actioning and participating in whatever is being communicated.

Communication is a rhythm thing – get into a rhythm, form the habit.

31

[Slide 33]

Repetition

Communicate a new idea or way of doing things six different times, in six different ways

When launching something new or hitting something hard that has fallen off it’s perch - six different times, in six different ways.  Continuous communication

Handout

32

[Slide 34]

Communicate! Communicate! Communicate!

Remember to follow up

Never underestimate the impact that you, as leaders, have on your team and always remember that whatever you’re communicating, it has a greater impact than you think.

33

[Slide 35]

Weekly Memo

Value of our weekly memo

The memo alone will never get the required traction

[Slide 36]

Tips
