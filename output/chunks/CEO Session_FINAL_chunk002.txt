[Presentation Topic: Customer Focus]

When launching something new or hitting something hard that has fallen off it’s perch - six different times, in six different ways.  Continuous communication

Handout

32

[Slide 34]

Communicate! Communicate! Communicate!

Remember to follow up

Never underestimate the impact that you, as leaders, have on your team and always remember that whatever you’re communicating, it has a greater impact than you think.

33

[Slide 35]

Weekly Memo

Value of our weekly memo

The memo alone will never get the required traction

34

[Slide 36]

Tips

Remember who your audience is

The lower you go in the organisation, the more often you have to deliver the message

Keep it simple

Flowery/fluffy stuff doesn’t work as well

Big words don’t work as well

35

[Slide 37]

The Purpose of the Weekly Memo

Communicates to the stores

Once a week – same day every week

All activities/instructions to be in that memo

All actions required to be completed weekly

Expectation that it gets done

Follow up is essential

[Slide 38]

Front Page

Must be written by you

Inspirational/good news piece

Reasons behind why we do things - strategy, processes

37

[Slide 39]

Pitfalls

NRM is the author

NRM approval on every single section

Nothing goes out without their approval

Nothing can be sent to the stores or any retail team unless in the weekly or SAM

[Slide 40]

Tips

Involve State Managers

Get your successor’s involved (i.e. State Managers to write an article or critique your memo)

Objective meetings:

Turn talk and discussions into actions and outcomes that will stick.

Professionally acknowledging, recognising, discussing and informing on issues , opportunities and challenges – a tool to effect permanent solutions and change.

43

[Slide 45]

Management By Objectives

Who is responsible?

Due date

Not a to do list

Not minutes of meetings

Objectives brought to the meeting

Discussion

Your  chance to add objectives

Talkers who don’t do

Time wasters

Going in the wrong direction

[Slide 47]

Why:

Issues are not forgotten, don't fall off

Ensures agreed accountability

A safe place to be candid

46

[Slide 48]

Fly by the seat of your pants

Make it up as you go along

‘I call them when I need to’

‘We talk all the time’

‘Our desks/offices are next to each other’

All will

let you down

Just demanding.

Management gets the team it deserves

[Slide 68]

A team never outpaces its leader

[Slide 69]

Passive versus holding your team accountable for outcomes and timeframes

[Slide 70]

Demotions or putting team back

Not adjusting their salary and what appears to be an easily justified answer

It will eventually catch up and eat you and the business.

Whatever you think, make sure you know that somewhere down the track, it will cause an issue

Customer Complaint Reports

Eliminate the reasons why we say no to a customer and how we empower our teams to do whatever it takes to please the customer.

[Slide 79]

It is never about what you’re doing – it is about what you’re doing for the customer!

[Slide 80]

To succeed, we must be passionate about the customer and put the customer first, always!

[Slide 81]

Customer service –

not lip service

[Slide 82]

We truly only have one boss – the customer!

The relationship with your boss must be taken very, very seriously.

[Slide 83]

Job satisfaction should be a by-product of putting the customer first, not the reverse.

Customer Satisfaction

Crew Satisfaction

Inter-related

[Slide 84]

In every discussion and every meeting, ask “how will this affect our customer?”

[Slide 85]

The point is that we must concentrate our energy on satisfying every single customer, every single day and every single time they enter our store(s).

Be obsessed about perfect service…

[Slide 86]

Good customer focus must be created, educated and repeated.

We must get into a rhythm..

We must support and remind   each other…
