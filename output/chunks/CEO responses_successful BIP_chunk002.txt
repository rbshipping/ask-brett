The final thing is to ensure that we all have a belief that we can achieve the BIP numbers before we start as that is what drives confidence and success.

Eliminating the thought ‘if we don’t get the budget this year we will never get it again’, I liken this to local councils or government mentality “if we don’t spend it this year we won’t get it next year”.

Using the BIP process to trigger thoughts or workshops to actually get a different result. So instead of saying “freight was 2% of sales so it will be 2% of sales this year”. Using this time to challenge everyone’s thoughts on “what would have to change for us to achieve 1% of sales” and use the collective group achieve real change in how we do things.

Linking incentive plans and potential bonus structures to what has been agreed and committed to in the BIP plan, i.e. so the business is focused on “one number” ensure that what has been agreed is then shared and measured against, both at company level and department level.
