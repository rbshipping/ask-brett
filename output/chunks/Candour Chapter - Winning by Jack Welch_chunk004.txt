So is eating lunch at your desk so you won’t miss an important

meeting at one. But for the sake of your team or your organiza-

tion, you do a lot of things that aren’t easy. The good thing about

candor is that it’s an unnatural act that is more than worth it.

It is impossible to imagine a world where everyone goes

around saying what they really think all the time. And you proba-

bly wouldn’t want it anyway—too much information! But even if

we get halfway there, lack of candor won’t be the biggest dirty

little secret in business anymore.

It will be its biggest change for the better.
