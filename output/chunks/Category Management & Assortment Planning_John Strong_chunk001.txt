¢ The H/H quadrant:

— Superstars which drive both high traffic and high

gross margin dollars

— Buyers’ job here is to try and explode the assortment

¢ The H/L quadrant:

— Produces high gross margin dollars, but low units

— All SKU’s in this quadrant are kept because

generating high gross margin dollars is more

important than producing high units

¢ The L/H quadrant:

— Produces high units, but low gross margin dollars

— Buyer will keep only the best SKU’s here and de-list

others

— A few SKU’s might become loss leaders to drive very

high traffic

— The key job of the buyer here is to try and improve

gross margin percentage (re-negotiating cost of

goods sold or through selective price increases or

through less markdowns and promotions)

The L/L quadrant:

— SKU’s produce both low units and low gross margin dollars

— Most of these SKU’s will be de-listed quarterly

— Some SKU’s may be “fixable” by improving margin or volume

Eventually, it would be useful to move down from “gross” to “net”

margin dollars by subtracting off all assignable costs related to each

SKU, usually through a technique known as ABC (activity based

costing). If we can get to net profit per SKU and then divide by

average inventory investment, we have NMROI (net margin return on

inventory)

Assortment Planning Lessons

1. Assortment planning / category

management is an ongoing activity that

requires good systems.

2. Alow % of items drive business

(20/20/60 rule)

3. Can’t de-list your way to a good GMROI.

GMROI is a “fixable” concept.
