managers in every store?

What lost opportunities could you attribute to having the wrong

store managers in place?

« What are the long-term consequences of not having assistant store

managers in stores?

Assistant store managers: One of the most crucial roles in

retail

| maintain that not having a store manager, or having the wrong store

manager, is a far greater cost to the business than the additional wage

costs of having full-time assistant store managers.

Assistant store managers need to be considered as ‘apprentice’ store

managers, meaning the role can't be filled by casuals acting as pseudo

assistant store managers, who are working while studying full-time and

who will leave the store to pursue their chosen career once they complete

their studies.

Having people who want to pursue a retail career as the assistant store

managers in stores is the way to best equip people to take on leadership

roles and will ensure you have a great pool of potential store managers

developing and growing with the business.

Rethinking the percentage of casual workers and relying on a larger

percentage of full-time workers could avoid a lot of challenges down the

track, especially when it comes to leadership.

Succession planning for senior

leadership roles

One of the greatest stumbling blocks for senior leaders is not having

potential leaders ready to fill leadership roles when needed, especially i

the business is in a growth phase. Ask yourself: :

how much time you spend identifying and developing future leaders

for senior roles

how much time you spend having career conversations with the

people you lead.
