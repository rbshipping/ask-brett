Preface

I had almost finished writing this book in December 2019, just before the onset of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic which represents possibly the single biggest disaster many of us will experience in our lifetimes.

The pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on all of us – socially, mentally and economically. Personally, within the space of one week, I went from having my business calendar completely booked with leadership workshops and coaching sessions to almost all of those bookings being postponed or cancelled.

The only positive I could find was that this allowed me the time and space to focus on finishing this book. There were times when I questioned the timing of releasing it – not because I had stopped believing in the content, but because I couldn’t predict if what I knew from experience and the proven practical solutions I believed I could offer would even be heard by their intended audience in light of the overwhelming circumstances with which retailers would be dealing.

Naturally, due to the impact of COVID-19, the priority for every retailer is to make business and management decisions that will enable them and their businesses to navigate a way through these unprecedented times.

In supporting many of my retail clients during this crisis, helping them to determine how best to lead their businesses and take care of their , I realised that the strategies in this book are needed now more than ever. In fact, it became a matter of urgency for me to finish writing the book and get it into the marketplace of retail businesses and their leaders as quickly as possible. Now, more than ever, there is a need for businesses to reconnect, refocus and re-establish goals. Assisting with this became my purpose and helped me to stay motivated and focused amid the business chaos I was experiencing myself.

It is now my mission for this book that the strategies it contains will positively impact retail businesses and their leaders, helping to provide some positive direction now and during the economic recovery to come.

How to use this book

This book is intended to support area leaders in fulfilling their roles. As I mentioned earlier, It has been conceived as a ‘how to’ guide containing strategies that will help you to find better ways to work.

All of the strategies in this book have been proven to work

Each chapter of this book focuses on a key aspect of the area leader role and you are encouraged to make your own notes throughout the book. Each chapter has a page on which you can write your ‘Light bulbs’; by this I mean any points that suddenly made something clear to you and to which you can particularly relate, or that you would like to discuss or reflect upon further.

Each chapter also has a page on which you can note ‘Actions’, meaning points I have made to which you not only can relate but that also suggest strategies you would like to enact and implement in your and in the way you work.

I encourage you to make use of those two pages in each chapter, so that you can start to create your own toolkit of ideas and actions.
