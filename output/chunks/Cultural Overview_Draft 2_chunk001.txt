The Power of Culture

The Brutal Truth:

• "If I'm tough on 10 + 1 it is because we need to be better than what we say we are.“

• Peter Drucker: "Culture eats strategy for breakfast“.

• Most retail failures aren't strategy failures - they're culture execution failures.

o Best & Less

o Beeline

• "Our job is to do what is right to win" - What does this mean for your business?

33

The Power of Culture

Why This Matters for Senior Leaders:

• Culture drives performance more than any

operational system.

• For large-scale retail, you can't be

CULTURE

everywhere - culture is your proxy.

• Strong culture = sustainable competitive

advantage.

34

The Executive Case for Culture

The Scale Challenge - What CEOs Face The BBRC Philosophy - Proven at Scale

• •

Managing large-scale retail businesses "If we look and behave like everyone else,

means you influence culture, not control we will start being like everyone else and

operations. everyone else is average". The difference

must be distinct and noticeable to customers

and team alike.

•

"Arrogance, ego and politics kills

culture. Driving culture is about

•

mindset and attitude bigger than the Poor culture → inconsistent customer

individual." experience → declining sales.

•

The brutal math: One bad store manager

affects hundreds of customers daily.

- Making Culture Work at Scale

Living the Culture Daily at Executive Level

The Peter Drucker Warning for Executives

• "Culture eats strategy for breakfast“.

• Culture has no KPIs, no prescribed rule book - yet it drives everything.

• When you see good or bad culture, you instinctively know it – it's what you choose to do about it

that counts.

• At senior levels, you ARE the culture - your team watches everything you do.

• Let your communication style cascades through.
