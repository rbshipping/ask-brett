The CEO Challenge: Making Decisions That Scale

Decision-Making Framework

• "A quick decision, even a wrong decision is a better decision than no decision.“

• "I don't want any CEO that needs a week to decide.“

• At large-scale retail business, delayed decisions cost exponentially more.

• Test and learn - don't bet the farm.

• If you got it wrong - change back.

What Makes Culture Sacred at BBRC

• Drawing from leadership insights on "What is Sacred To You":

Culture as Sacred Territory

• Culture and our 10+1 – "Walk it, talk it, teach it, protect it, nurture it“.

• Sacred means "inviolable – not to be violated“.

• Our culture commitments sit above urgent, above priority, above the day-to-day.

Protecting What's Sacred

• Don't let what is sacred be compromised by the urgent but unimportant.

That's how you know you've built something great.
