SPOTLIGHT ON PRODUCTIVITY

The Daily Progress Checklist

Near the end of each workday, use this checklist to review the day and plan your managerial actions for the next day. After

a few days, you will be able to identify issues by scanning the boldface words. First, focus on progress and setbacks and

think about specific events (catalysts, nourishers, inhibitors, and toxins) that contributed to them. Next, consider any

clear inner-work-life clues and what further information they provide about progress and other events. Finally, prioritize

for action. The action plan for the next day is the most important part of your daily review: What is the one thing you can

do to best facilitate progress?
