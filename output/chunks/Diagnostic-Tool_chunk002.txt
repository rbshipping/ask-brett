LEVEL 5 LEADERSHIP

THE GOOD TO GREAT® FRAMEWORK

The key is to recognize that the good-to-great principles are not a definition of greatness, but rather they represent a

series of principles for how to achieve greatness; they are input variables, not output variables. The first step in your

never-ending journey from good to great is to be clear on the two sides of the diagram below, rigorously implementing

the left side of the page and rigorously assessing your results on the right side of the page.

GOOD TO GREAT® CONCEPT SUMMARY

Our research shows that building a great organization proceeds in four basic stages; each stage consists of two

fundamental principles:

STAGE 1: DISCIPLINED PEOPLE

Level 5 Leadership. Level 5 leaders are ambitious first and foremost for the cause, the organization, the work—not them-

selves—and they have the fierce resolve to do whatever it takes to make good on that ambition. A Level 5 leader displays

a paradoxical blend of personal humility and professional will.

First Who … Then What. Those who build great organizations make sure they have the right people on the bus, the

wrong people off the bus, and the right people in the key seats before they figure out where to drive the bus. They

always think first about “who” and then about what.

STAGE 2: DISCIPLINED THOUGHT

Confront the Brutal Facts—the Stockdale Paradox. Retain unwavering faith that you can and will prevail in the end,

regardless of the difficulties, AND AT THE SAME TIME have the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current

reality, whatever they might be.

The Hedgehog Concept. Greatness comes about by a series of good decisions consistent with a simple, coherent con-

cept—a “Hedgehog Concept.” The Hedgehog Concept is an operating model that reflects understanding of three

intersecting circles: what you can be the best in the world at, what you are deeply passionate about, and what best drives

your economic or resource engine.

STAGE 3: DISCIPLINED ACTION

Culture of Discipline. Disciplined people who engage in disciplined thought and who take disciplined action—operat-

ing with freedom within a framework of responsibilities—this is the cornerstone of a culture that creates greatness. In a

culture of discipline, people do not have “jobs;” they have responsibilities.

The Flywheel. In building greatness, there is no single defining action, no grand program, no one killer innovation, no

solitary lucky break, no miracle moment. Rather, the process resembles relentlessly pushing a giant heavy flywheel in one

direction, turn upon turn, building momentum until a point of breakthrough, and beyond.

STAGE 4: BUILDING GREATNESS TO LAST

Clock Building, Not Time Telling. Build an organization that can adapt through multiple generations of leaders; the exact

opposite of being built around a single great leader, great idea or specific program. Build catalytic mechanisms to stimu-

late progress, rather than acting as a charismatic force of personality to drive progress.

Preserve the Core and Stimulate Progress. Adherence to core values combined with a willingness to challenge and change

everything except those core values—keeping clear the distinction between “what we stand for” (which should never

change) and “how we do things” (which should never stop changing). Great companies have a purpose—a reason for

being—that goes far beyond just making money, and they translate this purpose into BHAGs (Big Hairy Audacious Goals)

to stimulate progress.

LEVEL 5 LEADERSHIP

Level 5 Leadership has two primary components:

1) Put Level 5 leaders in the most powerful seats.

2) Create a Level 5 leadership culture.

Grade Range:

A = We exemplify this trait exceptionally well—there is limited room for improvement.

B = We often exemplify this trait, but we also have room for improvement.

C = We show some evidence of this trait, but our record is spotty.

D = There is little evidence that we exemplify this trait, and we have obvious contradictions.

F = We operate almost entirely contrary to this trait.

Level 5 Leadership—Diagnostic, Part 1: Grade:

Put Level 5 leaders in the most powerful seats. (A, B, C, D, F)

The leaders who sit in the most powerful seats in our organization are ambitious first and foremost for
