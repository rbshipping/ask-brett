Delivers Superior Performance: Grade:

(A, B, C, D, F)

In business, performance is defined by financial returns and achievement of corporate purpose. In the

social sectors, performance is defined by results and efficiency in delivering on the social mission.

Makes a Distinctive Impact: Grade:

(A, B, C, D, F)

The organization makes such a unique contribution to the communities it touches and does its work with

such unadulterated excellence that if it were to disappear, it would leave a hole that could not easily be

filled by any other institution on the planet.

Achieves Lasting Endurance: Grade:

(A, B, C, D, F)

The organization can deliver exceptional results over a long period of time, beyond any single leader,

great idea, market cycle, or well-funded program. When hit with setbacks, it bounces back even stronger

than before.
