Foreword

In my very first week, as a brand new area leader for the Flight Centre

Travel Group, I was sent to learn everything I needed to know from the

‘best in the business’. She was rumoured to have the most amazing culture,

the happiest people working for her – and outstanding results! Her name

was Alison Crabb and I was lucky enough to spend a day on the road

learning from her in that very first week in my new area leader role. That

was the beginning of my many years of learning, development and self-

growth, thanks to her.

Alison, or ‘Ali’ as she is known to me and to many others, is certainly a

unique human being. She has many times described herself as ‘an alien

on this planet’ and, in the most sincere way, I have to agree with her. There

are few people in this world who can find the perfect balance between

achieving business results, maintaining connections and living true to their

own beliefs.

I was in Ali’s leadership team from the beginning of her time as a state

leader and saw her grow from strength to strength in that role, as my

leader. Never afraid of a challenge, she embraced her role with a unique

and refreshing style. For Ali, leadership is a way of life and people are

the cornerstone of everything she does. She is disciplined, effective and

passionate about everything and this shows in her ongoing success. Even

when recognised as the best, with exceptional results and wide ranging

respect, she has always remained modest and understated. People follow

Ali because of who she is and what she represents.

This book is a taste of what has made Alison Crabb special to so many

people. It provides the ideas and tools that area leaders need to simplify

their roles and focus on what is truly important. The stories she tells are

about real people overcoming real challenges and her concepts are built

upon years of extensive on-the-ground experience. The suggestions

and templates contained within these pages are the tried and practised

methods employed by many successful area leaders whom she has led

and these methods have been refined and improved over many years.

They are combined here in an essential guide for all area leaders in retail.

Read these pages with an open mind and a desire to improve. Don’t let

your fear of change prevent you from implementing ideas that have been

proven to work. Take notes, think, write plans and, most importantly, act.

The strategies in this book will not only deliver better results for your

business they will also make you a better and more respected leader.

Since that one day on the road, learning from her many years ago, I have

been privileged to enjoy a powerful leadership journey and lifelong

friendship with Ali, for which I am forever thankful.
