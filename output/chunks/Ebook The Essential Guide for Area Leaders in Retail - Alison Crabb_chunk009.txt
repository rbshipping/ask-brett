Chapter 2 The four categories of area leaders

Support: Area leaders need to provide store managers with the tools and

training for them to be able to deliver on what is expected of them. Store

managers need to feel they have everything they require to do their jobs

and to deliver on those expectations.

There is definitely a correlation between the results achieved and how

well an area leader has been able to convey expectations and provide the

support necessary for them to be met.

I have found the differences in behaviour between area leaders can best

be described using the four categories illustrated in the diagram below.

As you read through each of the four categories and the behaviours and

results listed in each region of the diagram you will probably be able to

identify which description bears the most resemblance to your approach

and which quadrant of the diagram you are leading from yourself.

Defining area leaders by the support and

expectations provided

1 THE ‘ACCOMMODATING’ AREA LEADER

Stagnating Accommodating

(HIGH SUPPORT AND LOW EXPECTATIONS)

Low support High support

Low Low

An area leader categorised as ‘accommodating’

expectations expectations

will be more focused on the environment of the

stores in the region rather than on strategies.

Leaders from this category want to do a great job

and want to ensure the personnel in their stores

feel well supported. However, to achieve this, these area leaders often

create additional work for themselves and, as a result, work longer hours

to get the job done.

These area leaders often have a need to be liked and to please the

people with whom they deal. As a result, they often find it difficult to hold

store managers accountable for shortfalls in the achievement of budget

expectations, fearing that doing so would damage their relationship

with them.

They want to feel as though they are supporting their stores and, as a

result, will often take on too much responsibility – taking on tasks and roles

that should be performed by the store managers. They become the ‘fixer’

for everything and find it difficult to deflect responsibility back to the store

managers where it belongs.

Store visits are focused more on relationships with the staff rather than on

store results. These area leaders have a need for team harmony and they

struggle to make difficult decisions for fear of being unpopular.

Many area leaders new to the role will display these types of attitudes

and behaviours. If area leaders from this category stay like this for too

long, it may cause frustration – not only for the area leader but also for the

store managers.

Typical symptoms of ‘accommodating’ area leaders might be:

• difficulty holding their stores accountable for shortfalls in results

and standards

• struggling to have honest conversations with store leaders and staff

• lack of adherence to brand standards by stores

• retention of underperforming staff and leaders.

The stores overseen by these area leaders are often nice places to woLrokw expectations

but they underperform in regard to budget projections and low standards

are often accepted.

Store managers who are high achievers will often feel frustrated by how

little their area leaders expect of them and the lack of higher targets for

which to aim.

2 THE ‘CONTROLLING’ AREA LEADER

Leaders from this category will probably feel expectations

discouraged when stores in their region are not

achieving their budget projections.

Often this type of area leader was once a very good store manager,

leading to frustration when the store managers they oversee are not

doing the job as well as they did. As a result, ‘controlling’ area leaders

tend to put additional pressure on store managers, who then become

fearful, demotivated and feel as if their voices are being disregarded and

their opinions ignored. Store managers experiencing this feel that they

don’t have the support they need to achieve what is expected of them.

This can create a ‘them and us’ mentality between store manS ata gg ena rt sin ag nd Accommodating

their area leaders. When the pressure increases, it is likely thLaotw some Low

store managers will want to step down from their positions ore x mpe act ya t lio en as ve expectations

the business altogether, leaving the area leader with the task of finding

suitable replacements.

Typical symptoms of ‘controlling’ area leaders might be:

• focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) and results but not

providing store personnel with clear strategies for achieving them
