MENTOR AND COACHING PROGRAMS

A feature of great leaders is that they never stop learning. Mentorship and

coaching for leaders is a sound business investment which can positively

impact on your entire organisation and the people you lead.

While the specific challenges faced by individual leaders vary, the one-on-

one coaching process invariably allows leaders to improve their capabilities

and results, to experience greater satisfaction and to become at ease in

their roles due to them becoming more skilled and ready to respond to

opportunities as they arise.

You can benefit from complete access to my experience and support

from the training programs I offer, or from bespoke coaching programs I

design to focus on your individual needs over a timeframe that is right for

your goals.

The Essential Guide for Area Leaders in Retail

WORKSHOPS

If a key element of your organisation appears to be limiting the engagement

or performance of the people you employ, my workshops are designed to

get your organisation moving quickly towards better results.

I personally facilitate every session, ensuring that the learning is tailored

to your needs and you have not only the benefit of my expertise but also

my direct support.

Over time, I have observed the incredible impact of targeted training on

the areas which hold businesses back. Half-day and full-day workshops can

be tailored to target issues faced by your business, to ensure that the best

outcomes for you are achieved.

LEADERSHIP PROGRAMS

My range of leadership programs have been designed to take retail

leadership to a new level. As much as we all want to achieve results, those

results are really the outcome of how well we manage to provide a happy

and productive workplace environment and how well we can implement

our business strategies.

My leadership programs expand and elaborate on the contents of this

book, providing deeper understanding and learning, in a timeframe that

allows you to work on one strategy at a time.

KEYNOTE SPEAKING AND CONFERENCE WORKSHOPS

Do you have an upcoming conference you would like to use as a vehicle

to provide training for your team?

My delivery of keynote presentations and group training at conferences

has proven to be an effective way for me to share inspirational, actionable

insights with diverse audiences.

As a tailored offering, the presentations I deliver can be adapted to reflect

your organisation’s conference theme and key focuses.

EVENTS AND WEBINARS

Please see my website for upcoming events, webinars and workshops on

a range of topics relating to leadership and retail operations.
