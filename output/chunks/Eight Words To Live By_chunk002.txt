8. COURAGE

There are times when all the evidence in the

world cannot make that decision for you and all

you have is your intuition and instinct. This is

when courage plays a huge role. True pioneers

have courage in truckloads. When you are

starting a new business, creating a new brand

ARATE A Rata

geese

or creating a new revenue stream, often there is

little or no history to draw from. What we are

talking about here is courage — not recklessness

or danger.

Nothing in this article is new or

revolutionary. But most of the eight attributes

described are rare in business today. It is as

though the 20th century made them extinct.

The new economy will embrace people who are

audacious enough to practise these eight things

— not because they will result in more money,

but because they are decent things to practise.

None of these things can

be learnt in business

school.

Maybe it is a good

thing that start-up

pioneers rarely come out

of business schools.

Eighty percent of all new

businesses in the past

three years were started

by people aged 35 or

younger. We can only

hope the new business

leaders will remember

that fortunes come and

go, but good reputations

take a long time to create.

Bad ones are created

overnight.

In the Jong run, we

all move on. The same is

true for companies and

brands. Companies fold,

merge or are acquired.

Will you go through the

process with some class

or will you be remembered

as the person who nobedy

could wait to see fail?

Perhaps the greatest

challenge we all face will

be to dust off some words

from preceding centuries

and bring a 21st-century

spin to them: manners,

integrity, kindness, honor,

self-respect, relationship,

humor and courage. The

new business lexicon of

the 21st century. The

future always holds great

promise.
