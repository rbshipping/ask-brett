etailers have invested, and continue t@ invest, substantial amounts of

money in information 1¢¢hidlogy (i). By some estimates,' U.S. re-

tailers now spend close to $30 billion a year on IT, mostly to track

merchandise andoperations, automate transactions, and optimize

inventory levels and other supply chaift decisions. However, operational exe-

cution—a vital complement to planning and automation, and a key ingredient

to exploiting these IT investments fully—is woefully inadequate even at leading,

financially successful retailers. Drawin g on substantial interaction with multiple

leading retailers (and extensive operational data from two leading retailers), we

show that two particular execution problems—inaccurate inventory records and

misplaced SKUs (Stok, Keeping Units) in stores—are significant and expensive, and

they pose ajSérious batiier to the effective use of IT in retail operations. At the

two retails we studied in-depth, these problems reduce profits by more than

perforiiiance among stores within the same retail chain. Why is it that

incenti és, and the same corporate management and IT systems perform so dif-

fetently on these measures?

when demand forecasts for that item are updated by the automatic replenish-

decides to drop what is actually a popular item. At Gamma, one item at a store
