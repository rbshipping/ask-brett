etailers have invested, and continue to invest, substantial amounts of

money in information technology (IT). By some estimates,1U.S. re-

tailers now spenCd close to $30 billion a year on IT, mostly to track

merchandise and operations, automate transactions, and optimize

inventory levels and other supply chain decisions. However, operational exe-

cution—a vital complement to planning and automation, and a key ingredient

to exploiting the se IT investments fully—is woefully inadequate even at leading,

financially successful retailers. Drawing on substantial interaction with multiple

t

leading retailers (and extensive operational data from two leading retailers), we

show thato two particular execution problems—inaccurate inventory records and

misplaced SKUs (Stock Keeping Units) in stores—are significant and expensive, and

they pose a serious barrier to the effective use of IT in retail operations. At the

twNo retailers we studied in-depth, these problems reduce profits by more than

10%. More surprisingly, however, there were substantial and systematic differ-

ences in performance among stores within the same retail chain. Why is it that

retail stores with the same products, similar demand profile, identical monetary

incentives, and the same corporate management and IT systems perform so dif-

ferently on these measures?

Consider the following execution problems:

▪ Inventory Record Inaccuracy—Contrary to popular belief, most retailers

given item available at a store. At a leading retailer that we refer to as the

Gamma Corporation to preserve confidentiality, more than 65% of the

P

inventory records were inaccurate at the store-SKU level (i.e., “system”

inventory did not match “physical” inventory). Figure 1 shows the his-

togram of absolute errors (i.e., the absolute difference between system

and physical inventory levels for nearly 370,000 invento ry records).

Moreover, the absolute difference between system and physical was on

r

average 35% of target inventory level for each item. Gamma, we should

emphasize, is a leading publicly traded retailer with hundreds of stores

o

and billions of dollars in annual sales. The company scans allits sales elec-

tronically and has modern distribution centers that use information tech-

nology extensively.

Gamma is not an isolated case; this problem is common at other retailers

as well. For example, a large, well-knoywn apparel retailer found that

“physical” inventory levels differed from “system” inventory by over 35%

of the latter. The situation is even worse for those items whose sales are

p

not scanned electronically. At one supermarket chain, sales of “medium

tomatoes” exceeded shipments into the store by 25% because other types

of tomatoes such as “organic tomatoes” or “vine ripe tomatoes,” which

o

typically cost more than “medium tomatoes,” were often sold as medium

tomatoes when salespeople were in a hurry.

▪ Misplaced SKUs—Even when inventory records are accurate, items can

C

be hard to find at a store. At Beta Corporation, another leading retailer

whose identity we cannot disclose, 16% of the items in a store could not

be found by consumers who approached a sales associate for help, not

(as typically assumed) because the items were out-of-stock but rather

because they were misplaced in a backroom, in other storage areas, or in

the wrtong aisle or location. Beta, like Gamma, is a sophisticated retailer

with hundreds of stores and billions of dollars in sales. Figure 2 depicts

o

the histogram of the fraction of SKUs across 242 Beta stores that, at the

time of annual audit, were not found on the sales floor even though

inventory for these SKUs was available at that particular store (termed

N

“SKUs not on floor”). That is, the entirestore inventory for these items

was in storage or receiving areas and, consequently, no units of these

items were on the sales floor where they would be visible to (and thus

purchasable by) consumers.

Inventory record inaccuracy and misplaced SKUs can substantially

o decrease retail profits due to lost sales and gross margins as well as additional

labor and inventory carrying costs. By our estimates, derived in conjunction

with managers from Gamma, the profit lost due to inventory record inaccuracy

D amounted to 10% of current profits (roughly the profit of 100 stores) at Gamma.

Similarly, misplaced SKUs reduced profits by 25% at Beta (roughly the profit of

50 stores). Our estimates do not include the long-term adverse impact such exe-

cution problems could have on the firm’s brand image, a major concern for

senior managers at both retailers. The importance of these themes has been
