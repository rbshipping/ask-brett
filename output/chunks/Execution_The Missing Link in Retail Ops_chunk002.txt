reinforced by the personal experiences senior managers recount. At Gamma, the

CEO on a store visit noted that many items in a certain category with few substi-

tutes had stocked out. Subsequently, a limited and careful audit on 42 items that

he specified at eight stores revealed that 34 of the 336 store-SKU combinations

were stocked out on the shelves. However, 28 of these 34 combinations were

o reported as “in stock” according to the company’s replenishment systems.

The impact of inventory record inaccuracy and misplaced SKUs can be

severe for retailers like Gamma and Beta that rely on computerized replenish-

D ment systems for managing store inventory. At these retailers, when an out-of-

stock is reported as in stock, the item may never be reordered. What’s worse,

when demand forecasts for that item are updated by the automatic replenish-

ment system, the new forecast may be so low (zero, in fact), that the retailer

decides to drop what is actually a popular item. At Gamma, one item at a store

o

where the system showed 42 units in inventory was, in reality, stocked out. The

P

error in data caused the system not to replenish the item and because the item

had not sold in months due to the stockout, reduced future demand forecast to

ridiculously low levels. Similarly, with misplaced SKUs, retailers often fail to

observe consumer demand accurately, and this, in turn, causes them to under-

estimate demand for items that were misplaced at the stores.

r

Moreover, the successful execution of a “bricks and clicks” strategy,

presently pursued by many retailers, requires very good store-level execution.

o

For example, many retailers now allow consumers to purchase items on the

Internet and return merchandise to their stores. Similarly, some retailers have

tried, and many others have considered, allowing customers to view a store’s

inventory on the web. Such a strategy allows consumers to verify whether an

item is available at a store and even to reservye the item for future purchase

without having to visit the store. However, offering such a service reliably re-

quires inventory data to be accurate and also requires that items that are avail-

p

able at the store can be found easily by a consumer. Imagine the impact of a

consumer verifying on the web that an item was available at a particular store

and traveling to that store only to find the item stocked out because the infor-

o

mation on the web was inaccurate or because the item had been misplaced at

the store. Most retailers recognize that the cost associated with disappointing

customers after promising product availability is substantial. Not surprisingly,

C

many have shied away from offering their stores’ inventory on the web for

consumers to examine.

There is, however, reason to be optimistic; the incidence of these execu-

tion problems can be reduced. Our research shows that while execution is weak

on average at the chains that we have studied so far, pockets of excellence are

present (i.e., tsome stores perform better than others). Consequently, operational

execution can be improved quickly and dramatically if retail managers were to

o

create awareness of the magnitude and impact of execution problems in their

supply chain and learn from those stores that are currently executing well.

N

What Drives Poor Execution in Retail Operations?

We discovered these execution problems by accident. A few years ago,

we started studying retail supply chains and operations in a research consor-

tium2that included over 30 retailers. Our goal in this consortium was primarily

o

to understand how retailers do, and recommend how they should, forecast

demand and plan inventory levels and other operational variables in the supply

chain.

D

Our assumption in launching this research consortium was that retailers

had plenty of sales and inventory data that was “clean” and easily accessible.

Consequently, we were surprised when, early in our research, executives at a

small retailer told us about problems relating to inventory record inaccuracy.

We assumed that the problems were unique to this retailer and would not be
