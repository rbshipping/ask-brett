Execution: The Missing Link in Retail Operations

encountered by other retailers with more established systems. Subsequent field

P

visits to other retailers however showed that execution problems were wide-

spread. Over time, we were able to identify anecdotally the two execution prob-

lems described in this article at multiple retailers in food, apparel, book, music,

and office product categories.

Subsequently, we launched a more intensive phase of our research based

r

on data obtained from physical audits conducted at the store-SKU level at Beta

and Gamma. Both were frequently identified by other retailers in our study as

o

having stellar operations and systems. At Beta and Gamma, physical audits are

conducted annually or semi-annually; a team of auditors visits each store and

collects data on the amount and location of various SKUs. Stores are closed at

the time of physical audit, hence execution problems are likely to be less preva-

lent during an audit than during regular storey hours. For each of Beta’s 242

stores, we were able to obtain the fraction of a store’s assortment that had been

misplaced in storage areas and hence was not available in the selling area where

p

consumers could find and purchase them. At Gamma, we obtained “physical”

and “system” inventory levels and hence errors in inventory records for roughly

10,000 SKUs at 37 stores.

o

Our analyses revealed a number of insights that were interesting to man-

agers, and at least a few that were initially surprising to us. The performance of

stores measured on the two execution problems identified here varied consider-

C

ably. For example, average absolute error (between physical and system inven-

tory level) ranged from 2.4 units per store-SKU at one store to 7.9 units per

store-SKU at another. Similarly, with misplaced SKUs, the fraction of a store’s

assortment that was misplaced in storage areas ranged from 0.2% to 10%.

Moreover, store performance for both measures remained consistent from one

year to the ntext. The variation in performance among stores and the consistency

of performance from one year to the next is summarized in Figures 3 and 4.

o

Our statistical analysis (described briefly in Appendix 1) enabled us to

identify three broad categories of drivers: replenishment and sales processes at

stoNres and distribution centers (DCs), merchandising and inventory manage-

ment, and employee turnover. The stores had identical information technology

and monetary incentive mechanisms and were part of the same corporate entity;

consequently, these factors could not explain the differences in store

performance.

o

Replenishment and Sales Processes at Stores and DCs

The processes followed at stores and distribution centers understandably

affect the quality of execution in the stores. Consider the inventory record inac-

D

curacy problem—it is easy to see that store processes contribute substantially to

this problem. Almost all of us, when buying multiple, identically priced items at

a supermarket, say a lemon yogurt and a plain yogurt, have watched the sales-

person scan one item (say, the lemon yogurt) twice instead of each item sepa-

rately. This apparently innocuous practice results in two discrepancies between

“system inventory level” and “physical inventory level.” In the above example,

P

system inventory would exceed physical inventory by one unit for plain yogurt

and would be a unit short for lemon yogurt. Similarly, many of us have experi-

enced situations where, after buying a “large” garment, we returned to the store

to exchange the “large” for a “medium.” It is not unusual in th is circumstance

for salespeople to exchange the garments without entering either transaction

r

(i.e., the return of one item and the sale of another). Clearly, in this case the

system would underestimate physical inventory for large and overestimate

o

inventory for medium garments.

Store processes also cause the “misplaced SKUs” problem. Store sales

people are often charged with moving merchandise from the storage areas to

the sales floor based on sales of specific items. The task, though it appears to be

simple, is rendered complex by a number of fyactors. One, store salespeople, who

often are very busy during high-traffic periods, find it hard to replenish mer-

chandise promptly from the storage areas. Two, most stores do not organize the

p

inventory in their storage areas very well. Consequently, sales people may not

know if merchandise that has stocked out in the selling area is even available in

the storage areas. Moreover, computerized information systems that track the

o

inventory at the stores often do not maintain separate fields to identify storage

area inventory. The fact that storage areas are often dispersed over multiple loca-

tions and “SKUs not on floor” could be in any of these locations exacerbates the
