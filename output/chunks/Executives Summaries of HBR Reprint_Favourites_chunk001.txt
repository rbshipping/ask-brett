SPOTLIGHT ON HAPPINESS

The Happ

What practices can optimize employee

performance, delight customers, bolster

the bottom line—and even contribute

to national competitiveness? Emerging

esearch on happiness suggests some

urprising answers.

GENERAL MANAGEMENT

The Economics of

Well-Being

Justin Fox | page 78

Gross domestic product has

long been the chief measure of

national success, But there's

been a lot of talk lately about

changing that, from econo-

mists and world leaders alike,

GDP is under siege for three

main reasons. First, it is flawed

even on its own terms: It

misses lots of economic activity

(unpaid household work, for

example) and, as a single-

number representation of vast,

complex systems, is inevitably

skewed. Second, it fails to

account for economic and

environmental sustainability.

And third, readily available at-

ternative measures may reflect

well-being far better, by taking

into account factors such

as educational achievement,

health, and life expectancy.

HBR's Justin Fox surveys

historical and current views

on how to assess national

progress, from Jeremy 8en-

tham to Robert Kennedy to

Nicolas Sarkozy. He also looks

at where we may be headed.

The biggest success so far in

the campaign to supplant

or at least supplement GDP,

he finds, is the UN’s Human

Development Index—on which

the United States has never

claimed the top spot.

The Science

Behind the Smile

An interview with Harvard

University psychologist Daniel

Gilbert by Gardiner Morse |

page 84

Only recently have we been

able to apply science to one of

the world’s oldest questions:

“What is the nature of happi-

ness?” In this edited interview,

the author of the 2006 best

seller Stumbling on Happiness

surveys the field. Gilbert ex-

plores the sudden emergence

of happiness as a discipline,

reviews the major findings

{including the mistakes we all

make in predicting how happy

or miserable we'll be), and

examines the role of happiness

in productivity on the job. He

describes what makes us truly

happy—it’s not a promotion or

anew house—and sketches out

a “happiness diet” that empha-

sizes small, routine efforts.

Looking forward, Gilbert

discusses the breakthrough

work of his colleague Matthew

Killingsworth, whose iPhone-

enabled real-time surveys of

people’s moods are providing

an ultra-high-resolution picture

of how our emotional states

shift from minute to minute.

A sidebar by Killingsworth

offers a preliminary took at

his findings and their implica-

tions for our personal and

workplace lives.

ORGANIZATION & CULTURE

Creating Sustainable

Performance

Gretchen Spreitzer and

Christine Porath | page 92

What makes for sustainable

individual and organizational

performance? Employees who

are thriving-—not just satisfied

and productive but also en-

gaged in creating the future,

‘The authors found that

people who fit this descrip-

tion demonstrated 16% better

overall performance, 125% less

burnout, 32% more commit-

ment to the organization, and

46% more job satisfaction than

their peers.

Thriving has two compo-

nents: vitality, or the sense of

being alive and excited, and

learning, or the growth that

comes from gaining knowl-

edge and skills. Some people

naturally build vitality and

learning into their jobs, but

most employees are influenced

by their environment.

Four mechanisms, none of

which requires heroic effort

or major resources, create

the conditions for thriving:

providing decision-making

discretion, sharing information

about the organization and its

strategy, minimizing incivil-

ity, and offering performance

feedback. Organizations such

as Alaska-Airlines, Zinger-

man’s, Quicken Loans, and

Caiman Consulting have found

that helping people grow and

remain energized at work is

valiant on its own merits—but

it can also boost performance

in a sustainable way.

SELF~-MANAGEMENT

Positive Intelligence

Shawn Achor | page 100

Mast of us assume that success

will lead to happiness. Shawn

Achor, founder of the corporate

strategy firm Good Think,

argues that we've got it back-

ward; in wark he’s done with

KPMG and Pfizer, and studies

he’s conducted in concert with

Yale's psychology department,

he has seen how happiness

actually precedes success.

Happy employees are more

productive, more creative, and

better at problem solving than

their unhappy peers.

In this article, Achor lays out

three strategies for improving

your own mental well-being at

work, In tough economic times,

they're essential for keeping

yourself—and your team--at

peak performance,

The History of

Happiness

Peter N. Stearns | page 104

In the 18th century, the

Entightenment ushered in the

notion that happiness was

the attainment of a worthy

life. Since then the pursuit of

happiness has spread to every

aspect of behavior, from reli-

gion and politics to work and

parenting. Today the happiness

imperative creates pressures

that, paradoxically, can make

us miserable. Sadness is often

mistaken for a pathology. Un-

derstanding the cultural com-

mitment to good cheer as an

artifact of modern history, not

as an inherent feature of the

human condition, opens new

opportunities for understand-

ing key facets of our social and

personal experience.
