Steady, predictable growth is

what every big company strives

for, and what investors prize

above all else. McGrath set out

to discover haw many compa-

nies actually deliver. To meet

her initial criteria, a company

had to have a market capital

ization of at least usst billion

and to have grown by 5% each

year over a five-year period,

Only 8% of the companies in

her sample of 4,793 qualified.

When the five-year period was

doubled, only 10 companies

qualified—and of those, only

five had grown both revenues

and net income every year,

The success of these “growth

outliers” can't be explained by

industry, company age, owner-

ship structure, global location,

or economy (emerging versus

developed). They do, however,

share a lot of practices. For

example, they diversify their

portfolios with early, small

bets; manage major resource

allocations centrally; focus

attention on culture and shared

values; and hold on to their tal-

ent. Their practices add up to

an intriguing, counterintuitive

profile: Although they are

nimble and adaptive, their

leadership, strategy, and

values are extraordinarily

stable. The author concludes

that this seeming paradox is a

feature, not a bug: Stability is

what enables these companies

to innovate and to maintain

steady growth.

An increasing number of social

entrepreneurs and investors

are realizing that social enter-

prises of all sorts, including

many organizations regarded

as charitable nonprofits, can

generate returns acceptable to

the financial markets, The key

is to view the funding of social

enterprises as a problem of

financial structuring.

lf they treat charitable

donations as a form of capital

that seeks social, not financial,

returns, organizations can

then tap traditional sources of

funding: venture capital firms,

banks, mutual funds, bonds,

and so on. And with access to

these sources, they can make

use of all the toals for transfer-

ting risk and return, allowing

them to free up capital and

grow.

For this to succeed, the

social enterprise sector will

need to create greater preci-

sion and transparency around

measuring and reporting social

outcomes, and policy makers

must build the necessary

market infrastructure and legal

frameworks. With these efforts,

social enterprises could have

a larger universe of investors

than conventional businesses

do. This would be a significant

step toward a greener, health-

ier, and more equitable world,

Too many retail managers

believe that they must offer

bad jobs to keep prices low,

Asa result, almost one-fifth

of American workers suffer

low wages, poor benefits,

constantly changing sched-

ules, and few opportunities

for advancement. The author's

research reveals, however, that

the presumed trade-off be-

tween investment in employees

and low prices is false.
