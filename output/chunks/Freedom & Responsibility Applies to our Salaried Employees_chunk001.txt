To avoid surprises, you should periodically

ask your manager: “If |told you |were

leaving, how hard would you work to

change my mind to stay at Netflix?’

i

“Good” vs * Bad” Processes

Good” processes help talented people get more done

— Web site push every two weeksrather than random

— Spend within budget each quarter so don’t haveto

coordinate every spending decision across departments

—- Regularly scheduled strategy and context meetings

Bad” processestry to prevent recoverable mistakes

— Get pre-approvals for $5k spending

3 people to sign off on banner ad creative

- Permission needed to hang a poster on a wall

Multi-level approval process for projects

Get 10 people to interview each candidate

Rule Creep

* “Bad” processestend to creep in

- Preventing errors just sounds so good

* Wetry to get rid of ruleswhen we can,to

reinforce the point

“A ct in N etflix’s Best Interests”

Generally M eans...

Expense only what you would otherwise not

spend, and is worthwhile for work.

Travelas you would if itwere yourown money.

Disclose non-trivial vendor gifts.

Take from Netflix only when it is inefficient to

not take, and inconsequential.

“taking” means, for example, printing personal

documents at work or making personal calis on work

phone: inconsequential and inefficient to avoid

Bad tlIdeaes

¢ Manager sets pay at Nth percentile of title-

linked compensation data

— The “Major League Pitcher” problem

¢ Manager cares about internal parity instead of

external market value

— Fairness in comp is being true to the market

¢ Manager gives everyone a 4%raise

— Very unlikely to reflect the market

Developm ent

Form alized development israrely effective,

and we don’ttry to do it

- E.g. Courses, mentor assignment, rotation around

a firm, multi-year career paths, etc.
