Question 1

The big takeaway I have from this pre-read is how can we edge our business closer and closer to

having a more personalised shopping experience for our customer. I think easy to be daunted (or

excited) by the giant leaps in the pre-read examples – but we can start edging our way towards that

end state. The action for me is taking this objective into the work-out we are doing next week to

build our business improvement plan.

Some specific examples

 Product: we’re currently strong at a company level at reacting on a weekly basis to the

performance of our ranges and their position on the shop floor. While this can always be

strengthened - in the coming year we need to be able to do the same level of execution for

each market we are operating in. This requires a lot to make it happen – likely a couple of

extra ranges, automation of floorplans, building and reviewing yellow reports by region,

stronger regional comms. This would be great first step edging us closer to more

‘personalised’ shopping experience – and continue to take it further from there

 Marketing: we need to have a stronger voice by region (internally & externally) – stronger

marketing calendar that finds many more events by region to have promotions /add ons /;

EDMs and our social media comms in local dialects would be good first step

Question 2

The “face, bones and brains” I thought was a great framework which made me think about where in

the business we’re using technology and data. Traditionally we have focussed on product as this is

where business demands most attention. While we have a long way to go in this area – other areas

of the business have even further to catch up. For example

 Production process - tighter reporting and KPIs for work we do with suppliers. Product lead

times, cost prices, QC issues, growth & shrink of supplier spend. This will create better

dialogue with our suppliers, help us make better decisions as to who we work, improve

execution (getting product into store at right time) and improve product quality

 Rostering – currently exploring a reporting tool which will help us optimise labour in store.

Reconciling sales trends by stores with rostered hours

Question 3

While we are getting stronger on our analytics – If technology was free I feel customer insight is a big

gap which would be great to fill. Technology which would help us harness basic demographic

information through to preferences and buying habits. So capturing demographic information and

linking this to purchase behaviours / patterns (frequency of visits, what they’re purchasing and in

combination with what). This would go a long way in strengthening what we buy, where we allocate

it and how we market it

Bras n Things (George)

Hi Jason,

I managed to modify the first question as per the requested change. This was a challenging exercise

and really pushed me outside the comfort zone which shows how much work we need to do in this

area. As a suggestion it would be great to bring in expert as a group within this field to provide and

facilitate initiatives to develop the “Brain” of retailing within the group that will multiply the

effectiveness of the “Bones” and “Face”. I certainly don’t have the skill within the business and a

shared resource in this area to get us going would be great.

Below are the answers to the questions. Please note that some of the suggestion can be considered

wishful thinking but a futuristic thought anyway.

1. Based on the pre-reading report shared, what is one specific action you are going to

take in your brand?

a. Personalisation – Making sure the experience, communication and marketing

is unique by customer. This can only be done by investing in data analytical

tools (BI Tools) and smart analyst that can provide specific attributes of a

customer allowing personalised communication and targeted

marketing. Really understand behaviours, habits buying patterns and

communicate and engage based on learning’s.

2. How can we better leverage the technology and data that we have today, that our

systems are already producing or capable of producing?

a. Invest in BI tool to access the rich data we have and turn data into

information that will allow us to respond faster to initiatives that will drive

greater sales.

b. Invest in customer data analyst within the marketing team to really provide

customer behaviour insights and buying patterns allowing us to really target

market and properly measure effectiveness and engagement. This will also

help develop and rive an affective loyalty program.

c. We have just starting customer segmented EDM’s and we need to measure

sales conversions and uplifts and continually monitor and trial.

d. In Store search on the website – We have the data on what inventory is

available at what store and we know much of our online traffic is researching

to buy in store. We should merge the 2 and give customers the ability to

search inventory and truly implement proper “Click and Collect” It would be

dependent on data integrity of course.

e. Displaying current online reviews on in store products – Can show physical

headers in store calling out “Top Rated Product” according to reviews they

are capturing online. We are already capturing reviews for online purchases

at BNT, nothing stopping us calling out top products in store, removing

barriers to purchase in store and providing powerful feedback to customers

purchasing decision

3. If computer power is free what technology would we need and implement? and how

could you work it to your advantage?

a. Servers – More power behind online infrastructure means more speed for
