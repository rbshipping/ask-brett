Getting Around To Overcoming Procrastination

» ave you ever wondered about the word “procras-

tination?” Is there such a thing as “crastination”

and are procrastinators really good at it?” Does

“anticrastination” mean getting things done way

ahead of time?

Whatever the case, most people know what procrastina-

tion means-usually through personal experience: If you

occasionally or habitually struggle with this beastly condi-

tion, here are some tips to get you out of the holding

pattern and on your way to completing your tasks with

precious time to spare.

¢ Don’t Take on Projects Without:

-clarifying expectations

-getting all the information you need to do a good job

Often we procrastinate because we dread delving into

something we're not entirely sure how to accomplish,

Before you even /ry to get to work, get all your questions

answered, find out exactly what’s expected of you, and

obtain all necessary resource materials. Conscientious

groundwork will often head off the tendency to

procrastinate.

¢ Don’t Be Paralyzed

e Don’t Use the “I Still Have Time” Excuse

to Procrastinate Until the 11th Hour

When you do this, you’re robbing yourself of

quality time—-both for working and playing.

When work is rushed, com-

by Perfectionism

Some people can’t get

started because they

fear they won't be per-

fect at whatever it is

they're about to attempt.

Perfection is nothing

more than an opinion, Nothing or no one is

perfect. One thing’s for sure: serious procrasti-

nation almost guarantees that you won't have

time to do your best work—which is as close to

perfection as you're going to get.

e Break Down the Task into Non-

Threatening Segments

Sometimes it’s the size or scope of a project

that causes us to procrastinate. While the

entire project may indeed be overwhelming,

small segments of it will be much less

daunting. Divide the task into manageable

steps and focus on completing one step at

a time

e If the Task is Really Unappealing, Make

it Go Away by Doing it as Quickly and

Efficiently as You Can

In many cases, procrastination can be defined

as “prolonging the agony.” It’s ironic that we

often spend a great deal of time agonizing

over something that we don’t want to do,

thereby doubling or tripling the time we’re

plagued by it! Get it out of your hair so you'll

have more time to do the things you want

to do! Bi
