Final Thoughts

Behavior is more lawful than you think.

People are willing to give more.

+ Recognizing others will not be perceived as

weakness.

+ Use pinpointed behavior instead of labels.

Positive reinforcement is the key.

Don’t keep your appreciation a secret.

Watch out what you reinforce...
