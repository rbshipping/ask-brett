can imagine spending a million dollars,

Once you've settled on your approach,

be careful not to undercut your efforts

with gimmicks.

Don’t use the third dimension or

animation for animation’s sake. A

chart shouldn't move around or jump

off the page or screen~-it shauld stay

there and let the audience read it, Work

in two dimensions.

Don’t use a busy background to signify

the subject of the chart. No cloud for-

miations to suggest “sky.” Most photo-

graphic or brightly colored backdrops

interfere with visibility. Plain backgrounds

allow the reader to read the information

easily. Use white, black, or a pale color.

Don’t use lots of color to tie-dye a

chart. Too many hues confuse the

meaning. Think of color as information

itself, never as decoration to a finished

chart. Start with black and white. Add

color only when you need it to clarify

something, like distinguishing two thick

lines in a fever chart. if someone else

has created PowerPoint slides for you,

then use the computer to remove all

unnecessary colors.

WHO GETS WHAT

Don’t use ornate, flowery fonts. Use

one simple sans serif font in a variety of

weights and sizes, Keep the final size of

the chart in mind when choosing type

size. You might enlarge it to go into a

store window, on a banner, or on an

auditorium wall. You might reduce it to

appear ina printed report, where space

is at a premium, The final size matters,

not what you see on your desktop.

HARVARD BUSINESS PRESS: POCKET MENTOR SERIES

Plan for Visuals

AS you organize your presentation, identify opportunities to use visuals to get

your points across and make them stick in the minds of listeners. Everyone has a preferred learning

style, but most people respond better to visuals than to the spoken word alone. Consider the

following research findings:

« People gain 75 percent of what they know visually, 13 percent through hearing, and 12

percent through smell.

# A picture is three times as effective in conveying information as words alone.

« Words and pictures together are six times as effective as words alone.

Use visual aids to help your audience maintain attention and remember facts. Use them also to

help people understand ideas, relationships, or physical layouts. Visuals can also be used as cues

that you are moving to a new topic.

Remember, however, that when the audience is looking at a visual, it is not looking at you, so keep

visuals to a minimum. And do not use word-heavy slides to act as an outline; instead, know your

speech thoroughly.

Choose the appropriate media

You have many choices for your visuals, including computer-based slides, flip charts, and

handouts. When selecting from among these media, you need to consider flexibility, cost, and

appropriateness for your presentation.

MEDIAPROSANDCONS

Medium Pros

Computer-based « Easy to create, update,

slides transport

Flip charts * Flexible

# Easy to create

» Encourage interaction

Handouts « Useful for informal, short

presentations

«® Provicle a place for note-

taking and a takeaway for later

reference

» Can contain supplemental

background information

Cons

® Do not always project clearly

= Technology can break down, so

you need to have a backup set of

overhead slides

» Not effective for large groups

® Difficult to transport

# Can become the audience's focal

point, distracting them from

listening to you

If you choose to use handouts, avoid distributing them during the presentation. It detracts from

your presentation.

Effective visuals

Not all visuals enhance a presentation. If you're like most white-collar workers, you’re probably

familiar with “death by PowerPoint”—presentations in which the speaker uses too many slides,

uses visuals with confusing flow charts of boxes, arrows, feedback loops, and text, packs visuals

border to border with text or images, or, worse, simply reads the text in the visuals,

To be effective, visuals should

« Be simple

« Use graphics, icons, and symbols to reinforce or communicate a concept

» Use key words, not full sentences

= Use only one concept and no more than six lines per slide or page

» Use only three to six ideas on each flip chart sheet

« Use color, where possible, but not excessively

» Use pictures where possible

» Use bullets, not numbers, for nonsequential items

« Use all-uppercase letters only for titles or acronyms

Why the Best Presentations

Are Good Conversations

You don’t like to be talked at, anc neither cloes

your audience. So engage listeners in a dialogue.

Here’s how.

communications consultancy. He can be reached at hmcl@hbsp.harvard.edu.

A partner in a private equity firm was recently lamenting the irritating parade of

applicants who made a pitch for an auditing contract with his firm. During the first presentation, he

complained, the auditor droned on and on, piling on information the partner already knew or found

irrelevant. During the second presentation, the team making a pitch showed up with entertaining

slides and videos, but the show felt artificial and false—not qualities desired in an auditor,

So what was so special about the presentation from the firm he finally hired? Their pitch, he said, felt
