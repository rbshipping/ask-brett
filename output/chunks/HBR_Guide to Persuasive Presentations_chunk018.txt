4.King let his audience know exactly where he

stood. The most frequently missed opportunity

in business presentations today is the presenter

telling the audience how she feels about the

topic. What do you care about? Why? What is

important to you about the topic? Audiences

very much want to know the answers to those

questions, because they help listeners know

what’s essential to take away from the talk. King

left his audience in no doubt about his feelings.

Charisma comes from passion about the topic,

appropriately expressed, and King excelled here.

“This is our hope. This is the faith with which I

return to the South. With this faith we will be able

to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of

hope. With this faith we will be able to transform

the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful

symphony of brotherhood. With this faith we

will be able to work together, to pray together, to

struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand

up for freedom together, knowing that we will be

free one day.” It is said of the audience that was

privileged to hear this great speech that even

the FBI informants among the listeners were

impressed with King’s power and sincerity.
