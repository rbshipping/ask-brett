defensive, the company tailored its in-store barcodes to block customers attempting to showroom

using mobile apps. It refrained from placing barcodes on some products inside stores42 and used in-

store exclusive barcodes43,44 to prevent shoppers from finding lower prices through price-comparison

apps on their phones. It also offered products only available at Best Buy such as exclusive editions of

Blu-ray movies.45 The company then went on the attack and created its own shopping app. It also

partnered with third-party apps like Shopkick in an attempt to win mobile-savvy customers back to

its own brand. None of these actions seemed to deter consumers from showrooming. Eventually, Best

Buy took the extreme decision of always matching lower prices that shoppers found elsewhere.

Permanent price matching

Best Buy’s new policy of matching the prices on Amazon and other online retailers developed in

waves, becoming larger and more encompassing as its bottom line continued to suffer. In early 2012,

Best Buy promised to match prices from nearby brick-and-mortar stores, but carefully excluded

online retailers.46 Later in 2012, just in time for the holiday shopping season, Best Buy went further

and announced it would begin to price-match online retailers. This announcement was saddled with

a host of limits and rules. The matching would be good only for the holiday season and not during

the most lucrative shopping week, from the Sunday before Thanksgiving to the Monday afterward.

Further, only a carefully selected list of 20 online retailers would be matched, and the policy was not

guaranteed, as Best Buy staffers could decide whether or not to match the price.47 After 2012’s

disappointing sales results and another same-store sales drop of 1.1% in the fourth quarter, Best Buy

took price matching one step further. In early 2013, Best Buy announced it would make price

matching permanent.48

For the 2013 holiday season, Best Buy reframed this pricing policy as a front-and-center feature,

announcing its “low price guarantee.” The company embraced its image as an “internet showroom”

with a full-blown marketing campaign starring a host of celebrities, appropriately called “Your

Ultimate Holiday Showroom.” Eleven different commercials, which featured stars such as Will

Arnett and Maya Rudolph, focused on the consumer experience at Best Buy, both online and in-

store49 (see Exhibit 8). With that, price matching became transparent and permanent at Best Buy.

Will it Work?

With the high costs associated with maintaining nearly 2,000 stores50 and over 160,000

employees,51 most of which were not borne by online competitors, embracing permanent price

matching was a risky bet. Could Best Buy afford to sell its electronics, computers, and entertainment

products at the price points of online retailers despite having higher operating costs?
