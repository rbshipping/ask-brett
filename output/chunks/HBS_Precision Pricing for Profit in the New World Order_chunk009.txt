APPENDIX A

THE FALL OF COST-PLUS PRICING

The fastest way to commoditize a product or service is with cost-plus pricing. Cost-plus

pricing essentially gives away any special ability your company has to create customer value. It

makes the playing field between you and your competitors, and among the items in your service or

product line, so level that it destroys your competitive advantage. Cost-plus pricing never made a

great deal of sense. Now it makes even less! But, it still remains popular so it is worthwhile to

explain why it is so bad.

Cost-plus pricing was based on a number of usually unstated assumptions:

1. All relevant competitors had about the same cost structure.

2. Products and services were generally undifferentiated from one another. So,

value for the customer from different competitors’ products and services differed

little.

3. Costs were relatively easy to assign to particular orders, products, and services

because the really relevant costs were variable factory costs. Fixed costs were

not very important; neither were customer-related sales and service costs that

were subtracted from gross margin. Thus, gross margin percentage was a good

measure of profitability.

4. It was impossible to make individual, intelligent assessments of prices. The

computation effort in a multi-product/service company would be more expensive

than worthwhile.

In most current situations, these assumptions do not hold up:

1. Competitors with vastly different business models and cost structures regularly

face one another. Thus, your costs are not the same as your various competitors,

particularly for the individual items in a long product or service line. If you cost

plus price, your prices will not reflect the general market place. Customers will

choose competitors with the lowest prices, and put great overall pressure on all

prices. The smart way to price in such a situation is to carefully consider your

competitors’ cost structures and pricing policies, as well as many other factors

including particularly customer value, so you emphasize your competitive

strengths.

2. Much of the value in today’s products are embodied in intangible attributes such

as brand names, value-added services, and inteliectual content. These represent

opportunities for differentiation and unique positioning. Cost-plus pricing

reduces their value and turns specialties into commodities.

3. Variable costs directly related to individual products and services are much less

important in general, and in some cases are nonexistent or close to nonexistent.

More costs are fixed. And, more of the variable costs are customer-related

service and sales costs that occur “below” the gross margin level. Thus, it is

15

more difficult to ascribe specific costs to specific products and services. If costs

are not accurately known, how can one effectively do cost-plus pricing?

4. Fast, cheap computers, running intelligent well-designed software makes the

effective pricing of individual items even in long product/service lines possible.

This depends upon having a robust, powerful foundation for smart pricing. That

foundation lies in understanding and communicating transaction-specific

customer value.

In many service businesses, cost-plus pricing is known as “time and materials” because the

customer agrees to pay for time and materials plus a profit margin. This encourages the customer to

be more concerned with the vendor’s costs, and thus less concerned with their value from the

transaction. This is the wrong basic focus for the vendor to engender in the buyer. The seller should

encourage the buyer to think selfishly about customer value, price, and customer benefit (see Exhibit

1), and to leave the cost-price spread (profit) to the vendor. The astute vendor who is really good will

accept the opportunity and the attendant risk.
