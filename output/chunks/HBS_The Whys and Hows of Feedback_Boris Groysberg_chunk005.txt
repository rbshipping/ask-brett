SUMMARY: Effective feedback requires a comprehensive performance management system with clear standards, timing, and infrastructure to create trust and accountability.

boundaries can also foil attempts to give, or solicit, useful feedback.

Feedback also needs to be embedded in an entire context of performance management. This involves

goal setting at all levels of the organization, from the company as a whole to the individual and a

compensation and rewards system that is tied directly in to the desired competencies and behaviors.

Companies should have an infrastructure that supports feedback and performance management,

rather than leaving individual managers to figure it out on their own. There should be an agreed-

upon set of standards with consistency across offices and departments. A common feedback-related

problem is for organizational units or subcultures to develop very different performance standards

and practices around feedback. Organizations must maintain a balancing act between letting

individual units’ and managers’ feedback processes reflect actual differences in the work or

background of employees, and keeping a consistent set of practices and values organization-wide.

Having a clear feedback infrastructure not only prevents managers and feedback-seeking

employees from having to reinvent the wheel, but creates consistency, transparency, and trust in the

process, which is a key determinant of how people respond to feedback. Employees who trust the

feedback metrics and process of their companies are more likely to take action on that feedback, such

as by engaging in developmental activities.”

The timing of feedback can also affect its quality and should be considered as part of the

infrastructure. If employees are feeling a great deal of organizational cynicism, for whatever reason, it

may be wise to postpone feedback efforts until such a time as people have faith that improvement

will be rewarded (or even noticed).?! Beyond this, feedback mechanisms need to be timed to

performance events.

Reviewing a task long after the task has been completed allows memory failures and biases to

creep in, and also fails to give people the opportunity to improve in a timely fashion. Informal, in-the-

moment feedback may be best for this purpose, although formal feedback events should, as much as

possible, be tied to a meaningful schedule instead of being scheduled whenever is convenient. After-

event reviews, such as those practiced by the military, can also be a good feedback practice,

particularly in a project-driven environment. When corporate policy dictates annual performance

reviews, bosses should engage in informal coaching and feedback on a regular basis. In his book How

to Be Good at Performance Appraisals, Dick Grote notes that “Frequent coaching during the year is vital.

It lowers the fear factor people may experience during the annual appraisal discussion if that’s the

only time the boss talks about performance.”?

Organizational attitudes to feedback, as exemplified in leadership and practices, are also

important, Feedback should be seen as meaningful, acceptable, and useful. Cultures in which this is

the case tend to have employees who are motivated, committed, and satisfied with their work.4 One

way to create such attitudes is for leaders to model feedback-seeking behavior. “One must ask for

feedback in order to demonstrate the expectations regarding the frequency of feedback, what

constitutes suitable reactions, and when to respond or take action.”24

These kinds of feedback-friendly practices and attitudes are usually seen as part of an

organization-wide orientation to learning. As identified by David A. Garvin, Amy C. Edmondson,

and Francesca Gino, learning organizations have “(1) a supportive learning environment, (2) concrete

learning processes and practices, and (3) leadership behavior that reinforces learning.” Aspects of

the learning culture include psychological safety, appreciation of differences, openness to new ideas,

and time for reflection, Psychological safety, a critical component of feedback situations, refers to the

sense that it is acceptable to take risks, admit mistakes, or try new things that may or may not work.

This kind of talk sounds most culturally compatible with a “fail big!” innovative IT startup, but much

of the work by Edmondson and her colleagues has been in far more conservative and very high-

stakes environments —such as children’s hospitals, In one such case, developing a new “blame free”

way to analyze mistakes and accidents led to “measurable reductions in preventable deaths and

illnesses at the institution.”?6

In practice, an organization with a learning orientation and a good performance-management

system, including frequent feedback, sets itself up for a virtuous cycle of communication, alignment,

and improvement.

National Culture

There is a vast body of literature on cultural differences, particularly around communication,

cooperation, and competition, Cultures vary across a number of relevant dimensions — assertiveness,

power distance, individualism/collectivism, that will affect feedback.?” In particular, a divide has

been noted between Asian and Western cultures. Asians may be less prone to the self-serving
