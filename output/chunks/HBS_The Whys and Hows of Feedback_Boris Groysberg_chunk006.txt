The Whys and Hows of Feedback 416-013

attributional bias that can lead employees to overestimate their performance.?® However, seeking or

giving feedback may be avoided in Asian cultures as it could cause the loss of face or upset group

dynamics.?° Some Latin cultures as well may find formal feedback systems, particularly competitive

ones, to be destructive of organizational culture. Because the effect of different feedback techniques

may vary across cultures ~ for example, 360-degree feedback may cause stress in cultures with a high

power distance between subordinates and superiors — it is important to recognize cultural differences

when developing performance appraisal and feedback processes in multinational companies.3!

Cultural differences, however, should not be magnified out of proportion.S* Culture may affect

particular behavioral norms around giving feedback, as well as the value of aspects of the equation (the

social cost of seeking feedback, for example, might be higher in a shame-based cultures), but it doesn’t

change the variables, The building blocks of good feedback practices are similar everywhere:

¢ Motivation (employees high in internal motivation, rather than being motivated exclusively

by rewards, use feedback most effectively, and good feedback practices can increase

motivation),

« Trust (for feedback to be effective, the recipient must trust the giver’s goodwill and

competence, and the information and process used to develop and deliver the feedback),

¢ Organizational alignment and clarity (performance can only be judged against metrics and

goals; an organization that cannot define success for itself cannot define good or bad

performance in its employees), and

¢ A supportive infrastructure (feedback efforts need to be culturally normalized and rewarded,

and the skills of giving and receiving feedback should be coached).

Also, cultures are not immutable; some research suggests, for example, that modernization efforts

in China may be leading to more Western-style preferences in feedback.

416-013 The Whys and Hows of Feedback

Leaders who are working in a foreign country —or even moving from one distinct region of their

home country to another—are advised to get a formal or informal “communication coach” to help

ensure that difficult conversations, such as those around performance, are handled effectively. One

cultural difference to be alert to is the preference for straightforward versus indirect communication,

In some cultures, feedback is sought given and directly, whereas in others feedback is conveyed and

sought indirectly.4 In many Western cultures, particularly the U.S., self-promotion is considered

appropriate and not off-putting. Even within a particular country, industry and organizational

cultures can differ on this dimension, so it is good practice for leaders to pay attention to the feedback

norms in their particular environment before attempting to give or solicit feedback.

Erin Meyer offered the following practical advice in the Harvard Business Review for gauging a

culture’s feedback practices:

One way to begin gauging how a culture handles negative feedback is by listening to

the types of words people use. More direct cultures tend to use what linguists call

upgraders, words preceding or following negative feedback that make it feel stronger,

such as absolutely, totally, or strongly: “This is absolutely inappropriate,” or “This is

totally unprofessional.” By contrast, more indirect cultures use more downgraders,
