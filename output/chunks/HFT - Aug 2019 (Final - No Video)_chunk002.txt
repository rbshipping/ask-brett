6. MAKE THE FIRST OFFER!

✓ “Those who speak first, win!”

✓ Make the first offer to “anchor” the price and lead the

conversation

✓ Relationship enhancing vs damaging

✓ If they do go first, don’t ask them questions about it, ignore it

and go back to your offer

✓ Practice pre-framing to ensure no surprises! 1

7. FOCUS ON THEIR NEEDS!

✓ Identify what is their #1 pressing need

before the negotiation?

✓ Take the time to get to know them, what matters to them,

build the relationship vs rush to close the deal

✓ Be a pronoun checker – no “I” or “we”, its all

“you” or “your company”

8. PRESENT MULTIPLE OFFERS

✓ Present 2-3 offers you are willing to commit to

✓ 3 offers = a discussion vs 1 offer = a presentation

✓ Shows you are flexible, adaptable and improves

your relationship

✓ Allows you to gather info about what is important to them and

test what they have been telling you

Competition as Motivation

Brett

Competition

The most obvious benefit of competition is fairly straight forward – it

pushes you to greater effort and greater focus.

53

BBRC WORLDWIDE

Competition

Business is competition.

Our brains are our greatest weapons — if you’re not prepared to use it

to your benefit, then don’t bother fighting. You’re not fighting against

the unarmed. Everyone is equipped with the same weaponry — give or

take — only that most don’t use theirs properly.

"One thing I have learned as a competitor is that there is a clear

distinction between what it takes to be decent, what it takes to

be good, what it takes to be great and what it takes to be among

the best..."

- Josh Waitzkin

Competition – The Psychology Side

• Rival Effect

• When we see someone else just like us being able to complete a task and

gain the recognition we seek, we up our game to achieve these outcomes for

ourselves.

• We usually know who our competition is

• Activating the Brain’s Reward Centres

• Winning a competition activates the reward centres in your brain and

produces a rush of dopamine (the feel-good hormone).

• Small Competitions are More Motivating

• When the competition is smaller, we feel our chances of coming out on top

are higher, so we are more motivated to try harder – break them down,

country, state, region-store.

Competition – The Psychology Side

• If your friend, Colleague, sister, brother can do it, then why not you?

• No one likes to be beat; no one likes to lose. Our purpose is to improve.

• Not liking our friends outdoing us

• Who is your competition?

• Kim, for example

Complacency is the Mortal Enemy

• A lack of competition leads to complacency. Complacency is the

mortal enemy of growth and improvement.
