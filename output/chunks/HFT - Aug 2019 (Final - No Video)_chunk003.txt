Competition – The Psychology Side

• If your friend, Colleague, sister, brother can do it, then why not you?

• No one likes to be beat; no one likes to lose. Our purpose is to improve.

• Not liking our friends outdoing us

• Who is your competition?

• Kim, for example

Complacency is the Mortal Enemy

• A lack of competition leads to complacency. Complacency is the

mortal enemy of growth and improvement.

• The reason complacency is so dangerous is because people

become “comfortable” and “safe” with what they have and don’t

“believe” there is any risk of losing it.

• Competition and a certain amount of discomfort are vital for

those who wish to improve at anything.

Benefits of Competition

• Keep it Friendly at Work

• Done well Competition is fun

• Great way to inject some element of fun competition into the

workplace without making it about work.

• Competing teams or individuals respect each other’s strategies,

methods and ideas over time.

• Rivalries don’t have to end with one loser and one winner; rather

mutual respect and even strong friendships are often the results

of healthy competition.

Charles Schwab & Dale Carnegie

Carnegie liked telling the story of Charles Schwab, who had a mill manager whose men weren’t producing their quota of

work.

Schwab asked his manager, “How is it that a man as capable as you can’t make this mill turn out what it should?”

“I don’t know,” the man replied, “I’ve coaxed the men; I’ve pushed them; I’ve sworn and cussed; I’ve threatened them with

damnation and being fired. But nothing works. They just won’t produce.”

Schwab happened to be talking to his manager at the end of the day, just before the night shift came on. He asked for a

piece of chalk and then asked how many (parts) the shift had made that day. The man answered that the six parts had been

produced.

Schwab then chalked a big figure six on the floor and walked away. When the night shift came in, they saw the “6” and asked

what it meant. The daytime men told them that the big boss had come in and asked how many parts they made that day and

that’s what the “6” represented.

The next morning Schwab walked through the mill and saw that the night shift had erased the number six and replaced it with

a big number “7.” When the day-shift men saw that, they took it as a challenge. By the end of that day they had erased the

night shift’s “7” and replaced it with a “10.”

"The way to get things done is to stimulate competition. I do not

mean in the sordid money getting way, but the desire to excel.” –

Charles Schwab
