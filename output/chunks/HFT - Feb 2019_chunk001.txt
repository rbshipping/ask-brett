Cyber Security Update

Nico van der Merwe

Cybersecurity

In December 2018 at BBRC Corporate, we experienced an extremely

convincing and targeted cyber-attack:

• Hackers obtained access to an

email account

• Letter to ANZ Bank – funds transfer

• Email from supplier to change bank

account

• Email to BBRC brand advising

BBRC bank details

Lessons

1. Two factor authentication

4. Suppliers:

▪ Suppliers to be aware that BBRC entities

will never advise of changes to bank

2. Internal controls

details via an email.

▪ Division of duties ▪ If the email concludes with “await your

▪ Authorisation processes response” or something similar, it is a

scam.

3. Bank:

5. Emails:

▪ To obtain verbal confirmation of

▪ Request to change bank accounts

any funds transfer

▪ Email address
