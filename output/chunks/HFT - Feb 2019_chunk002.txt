Success Drivers

People

₋ Find the right leadership to drive online business

₋ Build the team to support growth, however be prepared to modify roles and

responsibilities over time. Digital changes rapidly, and team needs to change

with it

₋ Work with external vendors who will partner with the business and carry same

level of accountability as internal team

Omni Channel

₋ Good retail is good retail. Stay focused on the customer experience – must put

them first as it will drive focus, whether it be in store, online or omni-channel

₋ Experience between online and offline must reflect overarching brand

₋ Think of online as a store that is open 24 x 7

₋ Ability to offer additional products that you don’t want to range in all / any

stores – make sure stores can sell them

₋ Consider online as part of the in store shopping journey

₋ The store team must see the digital marketing and the website as helping them

achieve – communicate with the stores what you are doing and the store results

that come from these efforts

Success Drivers

Customer Experience

₋ Adairs customer remains focussed on speed of dispatch – although

this will change over coming years

₋ Understand what customer wants from you in relation to delivery

services and then ensure you work to meeting those

₋ Measure speed of dispatch or delivery and drive it down whilst

managing your order economics

Order Economics

₋ Understand the profitability of an online order including your

marketing costs to truly ensure you are creating a profitable channel

₋ Like all costs ensure you are constantly reviewing how to do the

process more efficiently

₋ Key Learnings – there are step changes in online pick and pack costs

where volumes drive your cost per order up – at those times review
