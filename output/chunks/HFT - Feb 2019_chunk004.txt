Economic Moats

Warren Buffett Explaining Moats

71

BBRC WORLDWIDE

Why Have a Moat?

An economic moat represents the

durable competitive advantage that a

business possesses that makes it

difficult to rivals to wear down its

market share and profit.

By keeping the competition away,

companies with wide moats are able to

consistently capture a great portion of

their economic value, and hence,

generate superior returns for their

shareholders over the long haul.
