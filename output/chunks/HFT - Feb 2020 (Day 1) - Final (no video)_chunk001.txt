“Acronyms Seriously Suck.”

Title of Elon Musk memo to Space X … he banned them.

Why we are going to follow in the same foot-steps?

• Disrespectful … form of power, knowledge isn’t shared

• Hurts new employees … they aren’t familiar with them

• People can’t remember all of them … they continue to build & build

• People don’t want to seem dumb … so they don’t ask / speak-up

• Inefficient … appears faster, but slows us down in the long-run

“Acronyms Seriously Suck.”

Future Benefits:

• Faster / better communication … plain language we can all understand

• Greater respect for the team … no secrets or code words

Examples:

• No more confusing project names

• No more “B&M” … physical & digital
