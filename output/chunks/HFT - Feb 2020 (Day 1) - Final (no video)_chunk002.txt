Setting up for success

✓ Companies <100 team: whole company launched together. Buy-in from all and go on the journey as 1 team

✓ Companies >100 team: start with Leadership team → then cascade to mid- managers → then rest of team.

✓ Internal “Company Champion” for company: passionate, tech savvy and in a position of authority.

✓ “Team OKR Champions” for each team: that are not Managers to build knowledge from within the team.

✓ Regular dedicated training with external expert: Detecon booked in quarterly for 1 year + fortnightly training for OKR

Champions.

✓ Training and buy-in from the top: Leaders are proficient and passionate.

✓ Part of our daily vocabulary: OKRs are discussed at our daily Huddles.

✓ Regular technology training: No use having the tool if no one uses it!

✓ Planning session post setting OKRs: to brainstorm KR execution for the quarter.

Refresher on what are okrs?

Objective

Objective = What is to be achieved, no more, no

less.

• Always aspirational

• Vision statement or the “guiding light”.

• Qualitative = no numbers

• Timeless - 95% of objectives roll over quarter to quarter

• Aggressive yet realistic – dream big!

• One line is best

Key Results = How do we know when its achieved?

• S.M.A.R.T goals

• Always with numbers = quantitative

• Change each quarter

Key Result

• How we measure success!

• Ask yourself what is the “best possible”?

FACT 1

“

OKRS DO NOT REPLACE

STRATEGY, THEY ARE

HOWEVER A POWERFUL

EXECUTION TOOL.

BRAD GILES

Tips

✓ Writing KRs- what is the most important thing that I can do to move the dial on the

business in the next 90 days? What is best possible?

✓ Leaders set their OKRs first (Level 1), then cascade to mid-managers (Level 2).

✓ Objectives live beyond the 90 days -You could have the same ones for years.

✓ Must have a single champion per key result.

✓ There is a skill to framing & wording OKRs – it takes training and time, however don’t

over think it!

✓ Use real dates - If every KR happens on the last day of the quarter, you don’t have a

real plan.

✓ Quality vs quantity- roughly 3 x 3 (3 Objectives and 3KRs for each team).

✓ Don’t be afraid to stretch.

✓ Invest 90% of your time on actioning KRs and only 10% on updating them in

Workboard.

“Scoring 60-70% is considered a success…if scores of 100% are achieved, it

means you are setting committed KRs vs aspirational.”

Traps

× Setting too many KRs – less is more!

× Setting easy or committed KRs.

× Making excuses for technology – Workboard is just a project management tool to record progress.

× Start journey yourself without getting external help

× Orphan OKRs that don’t align to the company OKRs

× Lead from the bottom vs the top

× Expect instant engagement and success – it’s a 12 month plus journey!

× Creating actions/task lists vs outcomes.

× Working on them infrequently. Must have daily & weekly focus and update Workboard weekly.

“The greatest risk to man is not that he aims too high and misses,

but that he aims too low and hits.”

- Michelangelo

Kpis vs okrs

KPIs OKRs

❑ Working IN business ✓ Working ON the business

❑ Day-to-day and often operational ✓ More strategic!

❑ More static and annually set (fixed) ✓ 90 day sprints & quarterly reset

❑ Business as usual ✓ Stretch, outside your day job. Concerted

focus for 90 days that adds value to the

business

❑ Keeps you in your job ✓ Above and beyond. You wouldn’t

performance manage on OKRs

❑ Around 60% of your time ✓ Around 40% of your time

“KPIs and OKRs do not compete, they complement each other”
