Biggest learning 1 –

Our social followers engage in posts

that make them “feel” something.

Why - Instagram is saturated with beautiful,

curated images and people no longer feel the

need to engage or like a post. People bother liking

when when something resonates with them. This

doesn't mean that we don t showcase our

’

products in the most stylish way on top models

and influencers it just means that we need to keep

adding personality and emotion into our brands,

Note – for increase in followers and website views

the competition far outweighs the bushfire post.

Biggest learning 2 –

Choosing to collaborate with fashion brands

(that are at a similar price) resulted in a far more

effective competition than our collaborations with

lifestyle and homewares brands.

Why : The collaborative partner had a very engaged

audience and they had not done a lot of competitions

before. We grew 4000 followers on the first day of the

competition and 12,000 in a 6 day period with very little

spend behind promoting the posts.

Blunder 1– Investing in a completely bespoke website.

• After continuing to invest in our custom website we have finally decided that our backlog in

development is never going to be addressed until we change the backend to a new

platform that has most of the plugins that we are looking for. This will allow us to spend our

money on truly innovative solutions rather than constantly playing catch up to create

software that already exists and can be added as a simple plugin.

Blunder 2 – Using a third party application to schedule our Instagram posts.

• Facebook didn’t like it and shut our ability to post and comment for 3 days. This happened

to be at a quieter time after Christmas but could have been disastrous if it was around our

sale time.

Best Digital Learning & Why

We hired a E Commerce manager

thinking this would be our solution to

all things digital.

We have learnt that a good merchant

running our website is not the solution

to embrace and conquer all the

challenges and opportunities in the

digital space.

Digital Blunder & Learning

Blunder

• We had a ‘live chat’ option on our site.

• The only things is no one in support centre

was there to “chat!”

• It was going to a message log that wasn’t

monitored correctly.

Learnings

• We were not on top of the functionality details.

• No one was objectively working their way

through the site to ensure it was functioning

properly and meeting our customers needs.

Microsoft Power BI

• All data in one place

• Easily accessible

• Inexpensive (sort of)

• The biggest take away-

having an unlimited amount

of data is useless unless it

is used.

• Having accurate and easily

accessible data is the first

step.
