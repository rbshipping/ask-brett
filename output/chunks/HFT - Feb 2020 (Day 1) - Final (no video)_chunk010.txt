Secret Santa promotion

• Due to poor planning, we didn’t allow enough

time to test the promotion internally, resulting in

errors and delayed launch.

• Customers also found this promotion whilst in

beta stage and managed to add free products to

their cart getting extremely disappointed when

we advised this was a technical glitch (some of

these customers were honored a free item).

greater difference have huge impact

has made a significant difference.

bang approach for roll outs.

• Learnings

• We could’ve launched our site and online

store 3 months earlier rather than waiting

on very thing to be perfect.

• For launch, a staged approach is a better

approach.

Best Digital Achievement & Why

• Achieved record sales and profit result in November Linen

Lovers member event, supported by a record unique

number of Linen Lovers shopping the event

• Strong team collaboration and execution, cumulated to

deliver an outstanding result

• Worked as a team to strategically map out pre-awareness

and in-event campaign objectives, identified all potential

customer groups, allocated digital media spend

strategically by channel/by day to gain highest customer

reach in most cost-effective way, and promoted

products/categories most likely to resonate with

customers

• Shared learnings from prior campaigns to make informed

decisions about customer and channel approach

• Tactically traded digital channels by day, dynamically

shifting spend and revising budgets based on:

• Sales and digital data metrics / on-the-ground

feedback from stores / regular updates with the

product team on product/category performance

Digital Blunder & Learning

• A/B test implemented on product page during a high

sales period and ran for 7 days. All three test variations

delivered a lower conversion rate than the original

product page

Learnings

• Two prior A/B tests had been successful, with

variations delivering lift in conversion, resulting in over-

confidence that third test would also deliver. As a

result, the team didn’t monitor daily performance as

closely as first two tests.

• Two key learnings:

• Be accountable – if you propose a plan, see it

through.

• Don’t wait to react - first two days indicated

variations may be performing below original

design. Test hadn’t reached statistical

significance, but test could have been ended and

re-tested in a quieter sales period.

Best Digital Achievement & Why

• Tested 3-customer retention options

• No incentive

• Free Product (From supplier)

• $5 off next transaction (approx.

10% off)

• Found that while retention was

higher by 12.3% on the 10% off it

was not worth the lost margin. Cost

benefit.
