The Ratios

1. Total Top Line GM$ Growth (TY/LY) %

• Total GM$ for ALL stores (including ONL, new and any closures) compared to LY

• Measures market penetration. GM$ means can compare low margin with high margin

2. BIP Sales Growth (Act/PL) %

• Business $ Sales compared to BIP

• Measures performance against originally approved sales Plan

3. Comp Sales Growth (TY/LY) %

• Comparative store sales (TY/LY). Like for like sales

• The most common ratio used by business analysts

• Measures comparative sales growth %, eliminating the impact of new stores

4. GMROM Growth (TY/LY) %

• GM$ (All stores) / Total Sq Metres (All stores

). Use average space for last 12 months for MAT calc

• The most important SRM ratio to maximise

• Measures change in space productivity

The Ratios

5. Retail Labour $ / # Transactions TY/LY %

• Store (incl ONL) labour cost per transaction compared to LY

• Measures labour productivity and is a reflection of the COS and GMROL ratios

• Use Gross Cost if possible but if you choose to use Net then be consistent TY:LY

• Note: This ratio is an inverse one i.e. a negative change is good

6. GMROI TY/LY %

• GM$ / Average Inventory (Cost) TY compared to same period LY

• Measures improvement in inventory productivity from period to period

• Beware that too high can be a negative indicator (as can too low)

7. GM$ per Transaction TY/LY %

• GM$ (All stores) / # transactions for All stores

• Measures improvement in profit productivity per transaction compared to LY

• SALE events show up here

33

BBRC WORLDWIDE | February 2022 -“The Magic 9”

The Ratios

8. # Transactions per Store TY/LY %

• Growth % increase in total transaction count / # of trading stores compared to #

transactions / store LY

• Measures the Customer reaction to the business’s offer

• During SALE this can increase dramatically but watch the GM driven KPIs
