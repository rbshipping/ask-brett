The Ratios

8. # Transactions per Store TY/LY %

• Growth % increase in total transaction count / # of trading stores compared to #

transactions / store LY

• Measures the Customer reaction to the business’s offer

• During SALE this can increase dramatically but watch the GM driven KPIs

• A steady, profitable increase in this ratio is the aim

9. Lead Add-On Sales Ratio TY/LY %

• Major or “lead” Add-On unit sales / number of transactions growth % of this compared to LY

• Understand what Add-Ons really are. A direct measure of Team performance

• Every brand should have one. This is a whole new “science” now

“This is a very powerful KPI that can be used to measure the effectiveness of

the ability of a Team Member to sell (i.e. making Customers successful), the

level of “buy in” a store has to company initiatives as well as by definition,

the ability of a Store Manager to drive motivate, train and manage a team.”

Mechanism

1. Every business to complete and forward Template very Monday

• Information required is common to all retail businesses and easy to attain

• Every retail management, payroll and finance system has this data

• Automated Excel macros developed by most brands

• Calculation methodology must be identified and kept consistent

2. Report compiled, rankings calculated then circulated

• All KPIs ranked using “best = low rank” method for Week, MTD, YTD and MAT

• Overall rank (and “winner”) calculated using “golf score” method adding all rank scores

3. Brands added and removed

• New brands (e.g. Lovisa, Honey Birdette) added

• As brands went public (e.g. Adairs, Lovisa, dusk) or sold (e.g. Sanity, BNT, Honey Birdette)

they were removed

• All BBRC brands had to be involved

The Report

(and how to use it)

Subsequent

Evolution

In 2012 the

“Magic 9 + Online”

New Online Ratios

• Consistent with “Digital First” Strategy

1. Online GM$ Growth (TY/LY) %

• Key result for ONL (excl bricks and mortar stores)

• ONL GM$ (TY) / ONL GM$ (LY) = % change

• Contrast with “Total (Top Line) GM$ Growth %”

• Increasingly important as ONL more significant

2. Growth in Online Conversion %

• Change in website Conversion Rate (TY/LY) %

• Measures website’s effectiveness in converting

traffic to transactions

• Primary results driving ratio

Challenges & Opportunities

Useless without all businesses participating

Not effective without all ratios being submitted

Easy to automate report via CSV file imports and Excel macros

Management not watching these ratios are not monitoring performance

Needs to be circulated early in the week

No business currently has “Add-On”?

Use as intended – a motivating, benchmarking tool and not a “drudge”

CEOs and senior management must be 100% committed

Use as Intra-Business Tool

Use as an internal performance monitoring and motivating tool

Lovisa

• Between Countries / Markets

• Between Districts or other significant segments where senior team has total

business accountability

Accent

• Between brands: Platypus, TAF, Glue, Hype DC etc

• Between States within brands

Modify concept to suit internal use

• Identify suitable, meaningful KPIs

• Rank using “golf score” technique and circulate regularly with fun commentary
