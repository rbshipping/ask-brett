Brett,

What a difference a year makes! Since we spoke a Trillion dollar valued company has changed its name to META and has gone ‘all-in’ on the Metaverse; and the Metaverse, NFT’s and blockchain are the hottest categories for the

investor community on the planet today. Prescient that we were discussing these things a year ago and that I’ve been investing in the space for a number of years. To that end big news on my front, I merged Thunder Studios and

my Metaverse company Infinite Reality with Display Social a few weeks ago at a +$2Billion valuation. Since then we’ve acquired an NFT exchange, which was just announced and we’re soon to announce a few other strategic

value accretive acquisitions. Here are some articles.

HOLLYWOOD COMES TO THE METAVERSE AS DISPLAY SOCIAL, THUNDER STUDIOS, AND INFINITE REALITY COMBINE TO FORM A MULTI-BILLION DOLLARMETAVERSE ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY (prnewswire.com)

Metaverse Platforms Are Joining Display Social -dot.LA

DISPLAY SOCIAL/INFINITE REALITY TO BRING EXPANSIVE NFT MARKETPLACE TO THE METAVERSE (prnewswire.com)

Unannounced, were soon to announce that we’re reverse listing on the NYSE (April/May) and changing our corporate name to Infinite Reality.

I wanted to reach out to you for two reasons;

1) I wanted to update you on our development since we met as I said I would.

2) I want to assist you in understanding the Tsunami of change that’s heading for traditional retail so you can exploit it.

The Metaverse is going to change everything. Here’s an article I published back in August that will assist you in understanding my views. Why and How the Metaverse Will Supplant the Internet -NAB Amplify (nabshow.com)

Consider the airline industry, consumers make flight decisions predominantly based upon the airline Rewards Program they are loyal to rather than the cheapest ticket price. The psychology of that behavior, through the

Metaverse will gamify everyday purchases that will completely disrupt traditional retail models.

In the Metaverse, Celebrities, Influencers –anyone with an audience will build virtual stores, curate their style and populate their stores with everyday products that represent that style (we’re already building them). Consumers,

fans of that celebrity/influencer will make traditional day to day purchases such as groceries, apparel, anything –from the virtual store of that celebrity/influencer whom will add virtual rewards to that purchase; it could be a

NFT, it could be a access code to a unique experience with the celebrity, it could be a number of stable coins (digital currencywith an affixed –non-speculative value), it could be a digital version of the physical item for use by the

persons avatar, etc.

Here are some videos that will assist your understanding -

This video is a virtual store example we built in 2 days for a brand partnership with Raycon(earbuds) and Walmart (transaction) https://vimeo.com/thunderstudioslbc/review/671521137/d973035ac0

We have a contract with UMG (unannounced) to bring their entire lineup of artists into the Metaverse and broaden their commerce and transaction opportunities. This video is a broadcast view (not first person) of an avatar
