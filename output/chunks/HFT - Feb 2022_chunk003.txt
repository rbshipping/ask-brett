What do you use the SRM for?

You can use the SRM model to analyse differences between:

• BIP and current year

• Your company vs a competitor

• Brands within a group (e.g. Platypus vs Hype)

• Store(s) to group, state, area, peer group (e.g. WA vs NSW)

• Area / Regional managers

• Categories within a store (e.g. dusk candles vs decor)

• All the way to SKU level (not GMROL)
