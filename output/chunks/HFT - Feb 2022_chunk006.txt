Capital Allocation

(Decisions, Patience and Compounding)

“Most bosses rise to the top because they have excelled in an area such as marketing, production,

engineering, administration or, sometimes, institutional politics. Once they become CEOs, they face

new responsibilities. They now must make capital allocation decisions, a critical job that they may have

never tackled and that is not easily mastered.” ~ Warren Buffet

If you do not become good at this, you will end up relying on investment bankers and consultants (not

desirable).

Moats and duration – without these two you won’t have capital (and no capital allocation riddle to solve)

Management team that never gets bored (biggest enemy of good returns is inability to sit quietly in a room)

People crave excitement and instant gratification => good capital allocation often requires patience and

compounding works slowly
