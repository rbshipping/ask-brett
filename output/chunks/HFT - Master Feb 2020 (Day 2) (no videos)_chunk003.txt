4. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT:

We strive for

excellence and are never satisfied – always raising the bar to keep

improving, even if it means changing everything we do. We don’t get

complacent and have never arrived.

Plus 1. DO IT NOW:

Make decisions, take action, get it done.

Everything we do, we do with a sense of urgency.

WHY DO WE RESIST TIME MANAGEMENT?

1. Belief of lack of spontaneity

Some people believe it is cold, cruel and boring to be organised and

efficient all the time.

2. Negative programming

We operate subconsciously in the same patterns as previous experiences

created by parents and other influencing people e.g. “you never finish

anything you start” or “you are a messy person”, and you therefore begin

being this person.

WHY DO WE RESIST TIME MANAGEMENT?

3. Lack of belief

Many people believe they don’t have the ability to be good at time

management.

4. Lack of training

Like Goal Setting and negotiation, we have not been taught how to

manage our time wisely to reach our peak performance!

1. GOALS AND OKRs

✓ Time management = Goal management!

✓ # 1 time waster is losing track of what you are wanting to achieve, or forgetting

what you set out to do.

✓ Clear and specific written goals and OKRs (Objectives & Key Results) will dictate how

you use your time and will create your daily priorities!

✓ Once you set your annual goal or quarterly OKR, have a planning session to list the key

steps and add your 12 week plan to Workboard and review each week.

✓ Ask yourself...

2. TAME TECHNOLOGY

1. Batch your emails and only check 3 times per day. Save time and stay focused!

Note: you may need to “re-train” your colleagues and suppliers.

2. Remove the pop up’s and resist the temptation to see every email.

3. Action 80% of all emails the first time you open them.

4. Keep most emails short and succinct and if in doubt, pick up the phone to avoid

misunderstandings. Keep to 3 paragraphs or less and use bullet points (or ticks) to highlight

critical points.

5. Send invites for every meeting, even internal 15 minute catch-ups.

6. Have a clean screen every week i.e. See white space at the bottom of your inbox and keep it

de-cluttered.

7. Allow yourself a “digital detox” when on leave.

8. Never negotiate or raise a sensitive issue on email.

Question: Why do we have internal ‘Email Free Days’ each month?

3. SHORTER BATCHED PHONE CALLS

• Batch your return calls all at once!

• Use the phone as a business tool – get on and off fast.

• “Just a quick call to say”… and “one last question before I go”…

• Give specific call back times.

• Plan calls in advance, treat them as meetings

• Calls build better relationships and reduce misunderstandings compared to emails

i.e. more calls less emails!

4. VALUE YOUR TIME AND PRACTICE PUNCTUALITY

❖ Successful people place a large $ value on their own hourly time.

❖ Outcomes vs hours.

❖ Have a sense of urgency! and strong bias to action.

❖ Just being aware of what you achieve in an hour will lift your performance!

❖ Practise absolute punctuality without excuse, every time, all the time! Start meetings

without the late comer.

❖ Watch your words – “now, urgent, I’m onto it, 30sec chat, speed, consider it done,

planning, outcomes” etc.

6. MINIMISE MEETINGS

➢ Every year review and ask: “Why do I have regular meeting?” with a goal

of culling 20% of meetings each year?”

➢ Ask is this meeting necessary, do I need to attend? - can I replace this with a call?

➢ Cover the most important and pressing items first

➢ Never meet without an agenda – “no agenda, no attenda”

➢ The most important meeting is your weekly 1:1 and use a shared agenda

➢ Preparation is the key to a successful meeting

➢ Be sure to start and stop on time. Keep most meetings to < 1 hour
