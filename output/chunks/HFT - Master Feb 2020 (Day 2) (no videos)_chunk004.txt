[Document: HFT - Master Feb 2020 (Day 2) (no videos).pdf]

➢ Every year review and ask: “Why do I have regular meeting?” with a goal

of culling 20% of meetings each year?”

➢ Ask is this meeting necessary, do I need to attend? - can I replace this with a call?

➢ Cover the most important and pressing items first

➢ Never meet without an agenda – “no agenda, no attenda”

➢ The most important meeting is your weekly 1:1 and use a shared agenda

➢ Preparation is the key to a successful meeting

➢ Be sure to start and stop on time. Keep most meetings to < 1 hour

➢ Clearly state the purpose of the meeting upfront and keep it solutions based!

➢ The fortune is in the follow through. Always issue action lists with time frames and champions within 24 hours

of meetings.

➢ Practise stand up or walking meetings. “Motion creates emotion”!

➢ Create minimum 15-30 minutes downtime between meetings for notes, follow up, thinking or actions

➢ Avoid “meetingitis”. Remember the magic mainly happens in the stores not in our office!

➢ Our most effective meeting is our Daily Huddle and takes 10 minutes!

7. TIME BLOCKING & DEEP WORK

✓ Create regular meetings with yourself for quiet, concentrated efforts

and keep them! Practice thinking time or “deep work”.

✓ Take on an “hour of power” each day for important and high value tasks and batch similar

tasks together. Don’t do at your desk…if they can’t find you, they can’t interrupt you.

✓ There is power in focusing and completing one task at a time i.e. Be 100% present!

”Focus breeds genius ”.

✓ Multitasking is unhealthy and unproductive!

AN EXAMPLE OF MY CALENDAR

Blue = External meetings ✓ Internal 1:1 meetings early in the week

Green= Internal meetings ✓ Plan the majority of the day

Yellow = Learning/health/personal ✓ Use your calendar for meetings, tasks & team time or deep work

Orange= Travel ✓ Treat tasks/meetings with yourself as importantly as meetings with other people

Red = Board/ASX

8. DAILY LISTS

• Create daily lists a week in advance linked to your goals and OKRs

– a life changing discipline!

• The more you think on paper/screen the less details you must remember

– it’s liberating once you get used to it! (a great “brain dump”).

• Do the most important and difficult task first up – “eat that frog!”.

• For every 1 minute you invest in planning, you save 10 minutes in execution!

• Create a to STOP list!

9. SHORTER DEADLINES, QUICK DECISIONS + DELEGATE

➢ The ‘Parkinson Principle’ – create shorter deadlines to achieve tasks faster.

It is the short time frame which keeps you focused, efficient and on task.

➢ Decisions:

➢ 80% should be made first time

➢ 15% make later

➢ 5% shouldn’t be made at all

➢ If you need approval for you decision, always include your recommendations

and why!

9. SHORTER DEADLINES, QUICK DECISIONS + DELEGATE

• Rule of the 3D’s:

✓ Do it

✓ Delegate it

✓ Dump it

• Delegate, learn to trust and expect the best from your team

• Sharing your workload can develop and empower your team

• Delegate or stagnate!

• Ask yourself what decisions will have the largest negative consequence and action

first?

10. AVOID INTRUDERS

• Be aware of “time vampires”, including yourself!

• Arrange times to meet with your team, minimise drop-ins and ask

“is this a good time or should we meet later?”

• Practise standing up when they come into your workspace and walk

out and remember, it’s ok to say “no”!

• Time vampires sneak up on your emails as well

• Beware of “Mr have you got a minute?”

+ 1… PROUD WORKSPACE!

✓ Get organised with your workspace and remember “your desk/counter

is not a parking lot”

✓ Create a “travel reading file” with non-urgent articles, trade journals, etc.

✓ Practise regular archiving and “when in doubt, throw it out!”

✓ Are you proud of your workspace? Does it help or hinder you?

✓ Would you be okay having a meeting at your desk with Brett Blundy or your

CEO?
