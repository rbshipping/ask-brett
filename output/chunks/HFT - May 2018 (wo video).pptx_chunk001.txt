“Acronyms Seriously Suck.”

▪ Title of Elon Musk memo to Space X … he banned them.

▪ Why we are going to follow in the same foot-steps

– Disrespectful … form of power, knowledge isn’t shared

– Hurts new employees … they aren’t familiar with them

– People can’t remember all of them … they continue to build &

build

– People don’t want to seem dumb … so they don’t ask / speak-up

– Inefficient … appears faster, but slows us down in the long-run

▪ Future Benefits:

– Faster / better communication … plain language we can all

understand

– Greater respect for the team … no secrets or code words

▪ Examples:

– No more confusing project names

– No more “B&M” … physical & digital

BBRC

Invest in the team, sign the number one

player

“All we worry about, is signing the number one player”

- Florentino Pérez, Owner of Real Madrid

BBRC

Global Expansion

▪ Logistics – supply chain

▪ You damage the brand by going into the wrong locations

▪ Meet local people and understand their life.

▪ Have a clear view of your own strengths and weaknesses.

▪ No formula it’s all down to the company’s capability’s.

▪ You will need to adapt your retail model.

▪ Beware of differences -Spanish people don’t like to shop in train

station, Italian people don’t shop in airports etc, etc.

BBRC

Things that really struck a cord with me

▪ There is no more weekend

▪ Stock market and quarterly reporting is the enemy of

innovation. Long term view wins every time.

▪ Out of stock still remains one of retails biggest opportunity’s

▪ Ramadan collection 10- 15 growth each year.

▪ The only real difference is the pace. KEEP UP.

▪ Doing something that isn’t easy increases the moat!

BBRC

Friction

We must seek & destroy

We must de friction

everything

BBRC

Good reminders

▪ Do not spend anytime worrying about what you can’t control

▪ Innovation needs to be part of the BIP, reported on planned for

and discussed relentlessly, until it is part of our culture

▪ Don’t wait, trial everything

▪ Speed

▪ A culture of innovation and performance is what’s driving retails

top performers.

▪ Multi Channel customers spend 5x more than single channel

customers

BBRC

RFID – Update

▪ Zara have incorporated RFID into their security tags and it is re-

useable ( can be recoded). They have there own algorithms for

recoding.

▪ 2500 stores in 86 markets - full steam ahead all brands

▪ They are expecting the RFID roll out to take 5 years

▪ ETAM RFID at 90%

▪ “RFID is the most important thing we are currently doing within Zara.”

- Amancio Ortega, Founder of Inditex

BBRC

What’s Next for American Malls

▪ “Physical retailing isn’t dead, boring retail is dead.”

▪ Stores will close the world over even though bricks and mortars

will continue to succeed.

▪ Malls have legacy issues, how do we stay nimble for usage?

▪ How do we deal with the leak in online sales from our

tenants?

▪ Allocate space to test new concepts

▪ Malls need to put the consumer at the heart of all decisions.

BBRC
