change.

▪ Diversity - young, old, gender, nationality, – we need it all

▪ Recruit bright and under 35 – the energy and fast pace of youth is vital.

Difficult to find these people but the most valuable.

▪ 60% of your time should be spent finding the best people

▪ The World is one!

BBRC

Help me………The assisted age

▪ Help me cut through the noise.. And do it quickly! Most

popular, statement ear, sexist, the most comfortable, black

with lace, high tops, hoops……

▪ We must be obsessed with speed

▪ Debhams 3 click check out

▪ Change has to be a permanent state of mind and must be

embraced.

▪ THE BRAND IS OUR BUSINESS

▪ Where is your customer, find out and be there

BBRC

Be present where the consumer is expecting you.

If your not already thinking of these

companies as your partners than maybe

you should be?

The Perfect page

▪ The perfect page!!!

BBRC

Its all about mobile

▪ We need to think about the role of mobiles in store ops,

suppliers, back office and training. Running the business

through mobile, its possible and will be an expectation going

forward.

BBRC

Suppliers =Partners

▪ Take friction out of all relationships.

▪ Reinforce supplier relationships, we can all improve. Discuss the

entire logistics issue with them.

▪ Faulty, how it’s packaged, sustainability, reduce freight costs,

payments.

▪ Ask suppliers how we help them.... placement of orders etc.

▪ Change name from suppliers to partners.

▪ Meet CEO to CEO, get in the room where it happens.

Digital Learning

▪ Three main themes:

– Frictionless

– Providing a Customer Experience Online

– Blurring the line with Store Experience

BBRC

Frictionless

– We need to be obsessed with speed. Every second online impacts the

customer experience

– 3 clicks to buy vs 13 clicks results in 55% less abandoned carts.

– Flawless delivery is the expectation.

– Average load time is 13s for a retail webpage.

– Target should be 3s not to lose customers.

– Frictionless payments, speed loading is important, no more entering

details.

– Mobile focussed

BBRC

Providing a Customer Experience Online

– It’s all about the experience both online and instore.

– Online needs to continually develop and evolve to keep content fresh.

– Rapid experimentation required on website.

– A vs B testing and then adopt quickly.

– Sticky where you are providing entertainment / experience / education

• (i.e. Sephora Virtual make-up artist).

BBRC

Sephora Virtual Artist

◦ Entertainment value

◦ Social

◦ Ease of use

◦ Complete list of all products

◦ Buy online

◦ Buy instore

◦ Educating and experimenting

◦ Upselling (Get the full look…)

Providing a Customer Experience (Cont)

▪ Not one homogenous customer, so have to consider those looking

for different experiences:

• Story telling is important

– The history of Honey Birdette

– How we design, manufacture etc. Can be stylised…

• Sustainability will not matter to everybody (approx. 15% of

shoppers at the moment)

– But will become more important over time as more Gen Z

become our customer

– Also increasingly needed to avoid adverse publicity / advocacy

– Sustainability is a journey, not a destination

BBRC

Blurring the line with Store Experience

– One view of the customer (over online and physical stores)

– Website should be in alignment with store experience

– Sephora Virtual Artist lets you try on the product when you are not in

store

– Tommy Hilfiger allows you to shop the runway show real-time

– Debenhams have a rail of clothes ready for when you click and collect
