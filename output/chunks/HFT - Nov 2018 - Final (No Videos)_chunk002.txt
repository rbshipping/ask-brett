PUT EBITDA BACK

WHERE IT BELONGS

Put EBITDA Back Where It Belongs

Why do we

reference EBITDA

so strongly?

Put EBITDA Back Where It Belongs

My View

Reference to this number has taken a life of its own

• Is lacking in authenticity and integrity

• Leads to bad behaviour & bad habits

• Misleading (mostly)

• False confidence

Put EBITDA Back Where It Belongs

What is best practise for us? Where EBITDA is it allowed?

• In the P&L (it has a place)……maybe

Where EBITDA is it not to appear

• Not in the CEO or CFO headline reporting packs or presentations

• Never before or more prominent then EBIT – Earnings Before Interest + Tax

• Never before or more prominent then NPT – Net Profit After Tax

Truth in Reporting

• Depreciation & Amortization – are real expenses – renewal/refresh/replace

of assets is a real and import costs of doing business.

Warren Buffett on Budgets

2018 Shareholders Meeting

“They do not submit budgets – never have – to me. I mean, they’ve been

required to. We’ve never had a budget at Berkshire. We don’t do unnecessary things

around Berkshire. And a lot of stuff that’s done at big companies is unnecessary.”

2016 Shareholders Meeting

“We never make a forecast on earnings. We don’t get out earnings guidance.

We think it’s silly. We do not have budgets at the parent company level. Most of our

subsidiaries have budgets, but they don’t submit them, or they’re not required to

submit them, to headquarters.”

2010 Shareholders Meeting

“I don’t have the managers submit budgets to me, there is no Berkshire budget,

you know. They can use them in their own operations. Some do and some don’t.

Many do, a great many do.

Warren Buffett on Budgets

2005 Shareholders Meeting

“None of our – our managers do not submit budgets into Omaha. I have no idea what

we’re going to earn next quarter. And, in our view, people that predict precisely what the future

will be are either kidding investors, or they’re kidding themselves, or they’re kidding both.”

2001 Shareholders Meeting

“Our instructions to our managers – we don’t have budgets and we don’t have all kinds of

reporting systems or anything else. But we do tell them to try and not only protect, but enlarge,

the moat. And if you enlarge the moat, everything else follows.”

1995 Shareholders Meeting

“Some of our businesses have budgets, some of them don’t. We don’t have any budgets

that come up to headquarters. We let .400 hitters swing the way they want to swing. And some of

them, you know, have a little different swings than others, but overall, they’re extremely effective.

Clear communication of a company’s strategic goals – along with metrics that can be evaluated

over time – will always be critical to shareholders. But this information, which may include

nonfinancial operational performance, should be provided on a timeline deemed appropriate for

the needs of each specific company and its investors, whether annual or otherwise.”

Sense Check

CFO to sense check the decisions, police the decisions, in terms of

cash and meeting our liabilities when they fall due.

Example:

Business decision – “50 stores need refitting”- assume business case correct.

• What do I need to consider?

• What's the right question?

• Did we budget for it?

• What's in the budget?

• Can I do that?

• Can we afford it?

• How do we pay for these?
