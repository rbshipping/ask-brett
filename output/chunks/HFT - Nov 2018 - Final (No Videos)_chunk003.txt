• What's in the budget?

• Can I do that?

Tips for Objective Meetings

Google – Project Oxygen 1:1’s

Set up a regular meeting

• Choose a consistent time, generally lasting 30-60 minutes, every week or two.

• Have the 1:1 meeting away from a conference room or desk - head outside for a walk.

Determine the agenda of the meeting

• Set up a shared agenda document to help structure your discussion time. Both the manager and team member

should contribute.

• Here are some agenda items to get you started:

‒ Check-in and catch-up questions: “What can I help you with?” and “What have you been up to?”

‒ Roadblocks or issues

‒ Goal updates

‒ Administrative topics (e.g., upcoming vacations, expense reports)

‒ Next steps to confirm actions and agreements

‒ Career development and coaching

Meet for the 1:1

• Be on time.

• Stick to the agenda, whenever possible.

• Give the meeting your full attention.

• Ask for feedback: “Is there anything I should be doing for you that I am not doing?” or “Anything I should be

doing better or more often?"

• Review action items and things to discuss in the next 1:1.

• Ask "What else?" (It's surprising to see what can come up as an afterthought!)

effectively and with rhythm

Active decisions and presentation on the following:

• Where does it change from “we will set the objectives” in the meeting

to “you bring yours & I will add to it”.

• Who shouldn’t have 1:1’s objective meetings? Is there a cut-off?

• Who should not / cannot do them weekly?
