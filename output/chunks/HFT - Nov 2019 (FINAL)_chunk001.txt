Inspirational Quote

For organization-level OKRs, the buck stops with senior leadership.

They must personally commit to the process.

*******************

What’s the moral of our OKR story? As David says, “You’re not going to get

the system just right the first time around. It’s not going to be perfect the

second or third time, either. But don’t get discouraged. Persevere. You need

to adapt it and make it your own.” Commitment feeds on itself. Stay the

course with OKRs, as I know first hand, and you will reap amazing benefits.

Measure What Matters ~John Doerr

Group Wide AfterPay Negotiations

▪ Trent has been leading.

▪ Aiming to get below 3%.

▪ The key variables that impact rates are:

- The collective size of the groups activity on AfterPay

- The value to AfterPay of exclusivity (formal or informal) [Note: he is aware that not all

are currently or will be exclusive to AP]

- The size ($) of the individual businesses on the AP platform

- The reach of the businesses (e.g. outside Australia, as they seek to expand offshore)

- The use of AfterPay online and in store

▪ Everyone filled out the template and returned to Trent, any questions or issues?

Subject: OKR’s

Boss man,

Ok it takes me a few goes until I see the light...

I must say I was a bit sceptical about this working when we did round 1 but now I have seen this cascade

down and it’s VERY POWERFUL...

We essentially have over 100 initiatives going on around the business with senior guys owning their

own and pushing it down with a drive to ensure they get done..

Matt Durbin and Adam in HR are owning this and I feel we come out of the quarter with much more

focus in a controlled manner..

It’s really good..
