Marketing Myopia

Brett Blundy

Article Overview

▪ Growth is threatened not from market forces, but from a failure of

management

- Railroad business or transportation business?

- Hollywood … movie business or entertainment business?

▪ Need to be customer oriented, not product oriented

- Do we really know the customer’s needs or only presenting them a

decision between Option A and Option B?

BBRC WORLDWIDE

Article Overview

▪ What is the benefit of knowing ▪ Businesses must learn to think of itself not as

the cost of an item, if you do not

making products, but as buying customers … as in

know the price that it can be sold

doing the things that will make people want to do

for?

business with it

▪ The CEO must:

▪ Survival requires only 1 thing …

- Set the company’s style, its direction, and its

change

goal

- Know precisely where he / she wants to go and

▪ Businesses tend to view

making sure the whole organization is

themselves as making things

enthusiastically aware of this

rather than satisfying customer

needs

▪ Unless a CEO knows where he is going, any road will

take him there

Another way to approach to think about it

Are we in the store operating business or are we in the business of making

our product available to our customers how they want it.

Digital first.

Reality

BBRC WORLDWIDE

Reality

▪ Media narrative - retail is doomed.

▪ Not true for BBRC. We have changed with the customer.

- Digital Experience

- Service … click & collect / click & dispatch

- Product Offering … endless isle

- 100s of micro warehouses via our store network

- Lower customer acquisition costs … the customer is already ours, we only have to ask how do

they want to be served?

▪ Retail is not dead … it continues to grow, it is shifting and we must shift with it. And be digital first in our

thinking.

▪ Put it another way if we think of retailing as stores and stores only -then yes for many, consolidation and

pain is involved today and in the future.

▪ If you rightly think of retail as supplying product that people want and desire and making it available to

them how, when and where they want it. Then our future success is assured.
