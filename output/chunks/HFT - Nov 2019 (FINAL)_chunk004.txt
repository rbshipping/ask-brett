“They haven’t been able to get their expense

structure as low as ours, and they haven’t been

able to get their associates to do all those extra

things for their customers that ours do routinely:

greeting them, smiling at them, helping them,

thanking them. And they haven’t been able to move

their merchandise as efficiently, or keep it in stock

as efficiently, as we do.

If anyone is ever able to top us in any of those

areas, we will have real concern. At this point, no

one has been able to do it.”

From Mr J. Charlton to Westfield

It’s a meeting no tenant would love,

so I had a word with the guy up above.

Please let Mr Bugden be kind,

It’s my livelihood….. He should keep this in mind.

I’ve battled in this ordinary site,

tried & tried to get things right.

So don’t increase my rent through the roof,

customers like us, TTP needs us, I’ve got the proof.

I don’t want to stay here and lose,

just make a little money, selling lots & lots of shoes!!

To Mr J. Charlton from “A Friend”

I wonder why they scream & shout,

It must be time for another bout.

Alas, their lease has come to an end,

I don’t think they want to be my friend.

I leased them a tenancy in just the right site,

they have traded & traded with all their might.

Their turnover has become 2nd to best,

in shoes they retail with great zest.

With their new lease they can retail their shoes,

After they have paid Westfield their dues!

Business Examples

▪ Example … digital online at Accent

- Crazy growth

- Customer service … 1 week before responding to customers, e-mail

response non-existent, phone is 48 hours, 1 return (lady wanted to return /

swap, she needed to do that for a wedding – didn’t respond until after the

wedding date). Under manned, under organized, no measurement /

tracking.

▪ Example … Online sales at Adairs

▪ Fantastic online growth … many orders taking 3 days to pick and

consolidate before ready to ship.

How to Grow and Consolidate

at the same time.

▪ A difficult concept– Building versus managing

▪ Different skills

▪ Awareness and Attitude

▪ Organized chaos

▪ Growth requires Change management– Sometimes forced

▪ Double back

▪ Acknowledge there is waste – find it – process and time to Identify and resolve

▪ Take out the garbage regularly – continuous improvement

▪ Fast growing companies In the chaos and excitement forget to weed the garden

▪ Growth hides all problems– They are still there doing the damage

▪ Who is doing what? And how is it getting done?

▪ Successful fast-growing companies need to do both– Grow at all costs but consolidate the

growth
