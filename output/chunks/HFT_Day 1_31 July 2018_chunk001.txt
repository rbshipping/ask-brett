• Unlikely source

15

BBRC WORLDWIDE

People Development – ‘A-Hah Moments’

• Innovation / ideas come from unexpected sources.

• Our people are full of thoughts + ideas we just need to set the scene.

• Ask for the team’s help:

o Delivered so much more than I asked for

o It builds connections, trust, and respect – both ways

• Both of these examples point to the same outcome:

o There is always more talent around us than we think

o Many people can & will step up

o We all get “better” when we involve everyone

• Our people are probably our greatest source of ideas / innovation and

knowledge.

16

BBRC WORLDWIDE

People Development

Can we Work Shop this?

✓ ✓

o Sanitize o Work outs

IDEA

• Every six months … our best people on the best opportunities

• Executives to prepare 2 lists:

1. List of opportunities for the entire organization.

2. List of the best performing people throughout the organization.

• Discuss these, meld the two lists together so the best people are matched

with the best opportunities.

Other ideas.

recent months), with almost no marketing spend (product samples only)

• Is there something different going on conceptually in Honey Birdette?

OR

• Is the digital success based on other internal factors?

o Attitude towards digital

o Created as a Digital and Physical concept (didn’t have to adapt)
