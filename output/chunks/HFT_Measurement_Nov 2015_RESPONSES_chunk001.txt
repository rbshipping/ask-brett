High Focus Topic Call – 10th Nov (Tuesday)

ELOISE MONAGHAN (Honey Birdette)

What’s the most significant change you’ve seen in your career as a result of starting to measure something?

As the business has matured I have shifted my focus solely focused on Sales Measures to Profitability measures.

Gross margin percentage

Store Contribution

Email numbers – run rate was 2,000 per month – Bel hit 4,971 in October as a result of focus and publishing it

Wages 20% of sales. Able to drive fortnightly robust discussion in wages report– driving business below 20%.

What should we be measuring? What shouldn’t we be measuring?

We should be measuring:

Gross margin percentage

Store contribution

EBITDA

EBIT

Wages

Rent percentage

Email database – open rate/ click through rate

ROS and success of product

We should not be measuring data that doesn’t directly influence the company’s profitability.

Why aren’t we measuring the things we ought to? i.e. what is stopping us?

I think we have a good balance at the moment – happy with all of the list above and I believe that we can measure too much. For example our GMROM on Toys is exceptional and the data would tell us to fill the store full of this category. The same could be said for the success of the higher price point bra at $140. The success of these styles tells us to only have higher price points in the business. It would be the wrong decision. A certain amount of gut feeling will always be the key to our growth.

PETER KING (Dusk)

What’s the most significant change you’ve seen in your career as a result of starting to measure something?

The most significant change is the move away from ‘’Gut Feel’’ & anecdotes for decision making to data driven decisions. While there is always a place for experience and knowledge acquired over years in a business/industry to have inputs, the use of hard data and analysis for decision making and resource allocation is replacing old style calls. Below is a simple example of how data and analysis has led to better decision making.-

Life cycle management ( LCM)

By using LCM within subcategories, we get more efficient in knowing which parts of our subcategories are performing and which are nearing their end of life and need replacements to be developed. This is especially useful at dusk for Fragrance products with 12 - 15 fragrances. There will always be SKU’s in Launch, Growth, Maturity & Decline. However, without rolling LCM charts, we may miss which ones are where on their cycle and revenues will ultimately suffer by not backing winners and sticking to long with poor performing products.

What should we be measuring? What shouldn’t we be measuring?

We should be measuring contributors to KPI’s.  Assuming KPI’s are directly related to the success of the business (increasing revenues, increasing margins, lowering costs speed to market). We should also be sure to measure non financials such as Team opinion surveys as these can be slow burners on morale and productivity that will ultimately impact performance and productivity.

We should not be spending time and resources measuring outputs that do not directly impact the above. Further, perhaps we should delete those reports that are not accessed for a period of time proving they are past their use by date.

We are not measuring the things we should be due to a lack of data, or management focus. Dusk’s new rewards programme is providing fresh consumer insights. It is easy to get lost in the detail. The challenge is to focus upon the top line metrics while setting periodical deep dives into the programme vs trying to over analyse too often. Another way to ensure we measure what we ought to is ensure we don’t try to measure everything, as per Brett’s cover note.

What could be stopping us is the time required to set up new processes and the discipline needed to keep the focus required, combined with the difficulty to stop measuring what was once important

GEORGE WAHBY (Bras N Things)

What’s the most significant change you’ve seen in your career as a result of starting to measure something?

In 2006 in the wine industry I implemented a sales monitor on laptops for the sales team that measured their distribution (product and customer) and product rate of sale then set bonuses based on specific targets. Within the first year we increased customer count by 22% and sales by 35% and within 3 years our gross sales grew from $110M to $185M

What should we be measuring? What shouldn’t we be measuring?

We should be measuring activities and results that are important to the success of the business that when measured can lead to an action for continuous improvement.

I know that sounds a bit ‘text book’ but that is how I think of it from a total company perspective and by the respective functions i.e. we should measure items that will drive behaviour, leading to bottom line results.

We should not measure activities that will not contribute to the business profits or strategic goals. If you have too many measurements then it is hard to get the team focused on the important factors that will make the most difference.

Why aren’t we measuring the things we ought to? i.e. what is stopping us?

This normally comes down to the capability of the team or even the respective department leader unwilling to be held accountable. Another key factor is the system we use ; we have good data, but extracting that data and turning it into meaningful information without the proper tools is time consuming and/or requires a specific skill which we may not possess, however, the main thing that prevents us from measuring properly is excuses:
