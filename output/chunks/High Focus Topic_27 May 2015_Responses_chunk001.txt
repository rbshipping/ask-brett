Honey Birdette, ELOISE

Discussion Points

1. How do you ensure knowledge gets through at your brand? (i.e. how does we share

knowledge today)

 Primary communication to our teams is via the Hive (World Manager) platform. We can

communicate the most important messages directly to the teams and our teams can

communicate with each other on Honey Chat.

 Every week Vanessa and the support centre participate in an 'Hour of Power’ activity where

suggestions are given to improve the Hive as an overall communication channel.

 HB as a learning organisation is incredibly open to new ideas. Due to the nature of our

brand every one has an invested interest in the product. All ideas including those which are

seemingly conflicting are valued and nurtured. Every week we have a Honey Wrap meeting

where we facilitate open minded discussion. Each department shares what is going on in

their unit of the business.

 We incentivse retail team with design experience days, where a honey has the opportunity

to give their feedback on current and up coming ranges. This educates both the honeys

and myself.

2. Do you prefer a formal or informal process, and if one over the other, why?

 Although our process comes across as informal it is actually formal. As our teams are quite

young we use informal language to communicate a formal message. We speak to the

teams in a way that they understand and can engage with.

 Culture of HB is not formal it is aspirational…

3. What's the biggest challenge you face in transferring knowledge? What stops

knowledge getting through??

 Limited time for reflection. Beyond the top level critical analysis, AARs etc

 Limited time for experimentation of new ideas. Little room for error.

 While there are concrete learning processes for our Honeys, there are limited learning

processes for new members of HQ.

 Limited amount of external education and training for smaller departments and units.

Example: formal external design training for design team

Discussion Points

Please also prepare to address the following 3 points on the call:

1. How do you ensure knowledge gets through at your brand? (i.e. how does we share knowledge

today).

Through our rapid growth we haven’t been great at this. One of the things that I have

implemented now is each 6 weeks I get the top 20 leaders of the business together for either a

half or full day to talk the issues in the business, what is required in the business etc. I have

found that the mutual accountability to each other is stronger than the accountability to me.

In this I have had a huge amount of feedback, form various departments, especially the field

team of ‘wow, there is a lot of other things that happen in the business’.

We also do a Monday Mngt meeting that we deliberately keep informal to talk through all of the

key issues, again these can go off on a tangent but being aware the great learning it there.

(Paul): Only other thing to add here is I think Lovisa is good at AAR process. Mostly bigger

formal ones (i.e., around Christmas or sale or bigger initiatives such as an implementation or

big store transfers). I think we could do better at more informal ones on smaller initiatives

2. Do you prefer a formal or informal process, and if one over the other, why?

Informal as this is more my style of learning and teaching i.e. on the job. I fond retailers get

fidgety to easily.

3. What's the biggest challenge you face in transferring knowledge?

Time, we run fast and rarely take the time to sit down and have meaningful discussions, hence we

have taken the opportunity to do the 6 weeks discussions.

(Paul): Only other thing I’d say here which survey highlighted here is it’s less about transferring the

knowledge but finding time to build the knowledge in areas we may not have strength internally –

i.e., we know we are weak and can improve in areas such as supply chain management or even

marketing – and about making the time to meet with others to build our knowledge base and

understanding of what good really looks like

- What stops knowledge getting through??

Again I think the challenge is time and the can do attitude in our business can also mean a lot of

team ‘just do’ rather than think things through and take team on the journey.

1) Inductions for new employees and embedded processes for existing employees.

New employees in all sections of the company participate in an induction process when

they commence employment. This is as much about how we operate and the culture as it is

about the obligatory OH&S rules. This is the first step in ensuring the new hire is open to

give and receive feedback which leads to participating in discussions on business

improvement specific to their role and in time to the broader business. By preparing new

team members for PAR’s for example, they are more open to the feedback they will

receive. Which if delivered properly, leads to improved performance through knowledge

transfer to all new team members.

For existing employees, Knowledge is passed on or indeed created in the processes we

undertake. At dusk, we pay special attention to AAR’s for Mother’s Day and of course

Xmas. Knowledge is generated and created during these meetings when insights on what

we did, how we did it and was it successful are shared. Critical to this is the environment.
