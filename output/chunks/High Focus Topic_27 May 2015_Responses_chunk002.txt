undertake. At dusk, we pay special attention to AAR’s for Mother’s Day and of course

Xmas. Knowledge is generated and created during these meetings when insights on what

we did, how we did it and was it successful are shared. Critical to this is the environment.

The article calls this “Psychological safety”, the ability to have an opinion or ask a question

which may go against existing strategy or Ways Of Doing Business( WODB). Without this,

full value from all participants is not reached. The same is true of the BIP process. The

process is all about how do we become a better business , how do perform at a higher level

than we have previously. This should involve drawing differing points of view based upon

insights , analysis and experience.

In summary, knowledge “gets through” by having people feel sufficiently safe to express

ideas and opinions. The counterbalance for this is the need to listen objectively to the

differing points of view. The right to be heard is not the right to be right.

2) I prefer knowledge transfer to take place using formal processes, in an informal

environment. Our AAR’s and BIP’s are formal sessions with agendas , pre work , assigned

leaders for different sections etc. The structure is critical to ensure focus and accountability.

However, once we have the right team and the talent is assembled and organized to

deliver, a degree of informality is best as it relaxes participants who may not otherwise

speak up and contribute. This is especially true of large groups who may not necessarily

meet often ( Regional managers meeting with CS team members). The leader of the

process, mostly the CEO needs to ensure a balance between informal for openness and

formality to ensure we generate tangible workable results the entire team buys into. The

leader also needs to ensure all are contributing and all those who speak are listened to and

questions asked are addressed and not dismissed. This can get difficult when timing is tight

and the topics relate to underperforming areas of an organization. This is where formality

returns by respecting each other’s time and the focus upon the bigger picture of

performance. That said, as the article states, “ The goal….is to promote dialogue, not

critique”

3) The biggest challenge is spelt out in the survey. Daily/weekly/monthly schedules can and

do get in the way of scheduling sufficient time to prepare and properly participate. The

temptation to rush a review, cut short a discussion, not allow extended time to really dig into

an area of opportunity or potential underperformance and simply agree to execute the

same activity again is looms when deadlines for day to day work are present. Transfer and

creation of knowledge takes time, preparation and focus. This is where the leader of the

session/programme has to make clear the importance of the process and pre plan to have

sufficient time and attendees present to get the best results.

2. Do you prefer a formal or informal process, and if one over the other, why?

Team Members learn from both formal and informal processes so it is important that we use both

to share knowledge and create a stronger Learning Organisation.

Examples of formal and informal processes:

Formal Informal

Weekly Memos Mentoring

Training booklets Leading by example

E-learning modules Morning and End of Day Calls to all stores

Retail Training programs Kerbside coaching

Detailed induction processes Trial and error

State and Area Manager Conferences Lunches and after work drinks

Benefits of Formal Processes:

 A controlled and structured approach

 Large numbers of Team will learn the same information and/or processes at the same

time.ie get consistency.

 You have more control over the content covered and the learning experience for your team

 The content should always be accurate and up to date.

 Team members learning through formal training programs generally come up to speed

faster following the course.

 Properly designed formal training programs can include a variety of methods to appeal to

all learning styles.

Benefits of Informal Processes:

 Provides a lot more flexibility in the way content is both created and consumed. Generally

more convenient for the audience.

 Can be less costly and more time efficient.

 Can be more personal and less intimidating for some Team.

 Subject-matter experts may be more willing to share their knowledge with others this way.

 Team can learn on the job, learning from other experienced team through listening and

modelling their behaviours.

 Since learning this way happens more naturally during the flow of someone’s work day,

Team Member may be less likely to resist learning new things.

It is important to recognise that our Team Members learn both for informal and formal
