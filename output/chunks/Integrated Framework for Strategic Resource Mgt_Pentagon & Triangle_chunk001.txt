Margin

Net Profit AT

Net Sales

Return on Sales

[ROS] is Net Profits

or Earnings after

taxes divided by Net

Sales of a retailer.

This ratio is the

traditional measure of

“bottom line” in any

enterprise-i.e., what's

returned to the

enterprise for

reinvestment or

distribution on every

dollar of sale.

Level 1, Tool #2:

Strategic Profit Model (DuPont Model)

Asset

Total Assets

Asset Turnover [A/T

or T/O] is Net Sales

divided by the Total

Assets employed in

a business.

This ratio measures

how “productively”

the investments in a

business are used to

generate sales.

Management

Net Saies

ROA

Net Profit AT

Total Assets

Return on Assets

[ROA] is Net Profits AT

divided by the Total

Assets employed in a

business.

This ratio is the single

most important

measure of the “raw”

earning power or the

profitability of all the

assets employed in an

enterprise.

Financial

Management

Total Assets

Net Worth

Financial Leverage

[F/L] is Total Assets

divided by the total

Net Worth or Owner's

Equity in a business.

This ratio measures

the extent to which

the business is

financed by debt or

shareholder's equity.

or Equity [RONW or

ROE] is Net Profits AT

- Objectives:

— 1. Maintain as much sales as possible

~- 2. Try to improve productivity performance (GMROID

— Decision Process:

~ J. Assumptions about consumer buying behavior for your type store?

~ 2, Line selection process—which sorts did you analyze? Why? What decisions did you make?

- 3. What other changes did you make? Prices? Inventory?

e The L/L quadrant:

~— SKU’s produce both low units and low gross margin dollars

— Most of these SKU’s will be de-listed quarterly

— Some SKU’s may be “fixable” by improving margin or volume

— Eventually, it would be useful to move down from “gross” to “net” margin

dollars by subtracting off all assignable costs related to each SKU, usually

through a technique known as ABC (activity based costing). If we can get to

net profit per SKU and then divide by average inventory investment, we have

NMROI (net margin return on inventory)

Category Roles and

Measurements

An Integrated Framework For Strategic Resource Management - 27

e The L/H quadrant:

— Produces high units, but low gross margin dollars

— Buyer will keep only the best SKU’s here and de-list

others

— A few SKU’s might become loss leaders to drive very high

traffic

— The key job of the buyer here is to try and improve gross

margin percentage (re-negotiating cost of goods sold or

through selective price increases or through less

markdowns and promotions)

Category Roles and

Measurements

An Integrate” ~ramework For Strategic Resource Management - 26

e The H/H quadrant:

— Superstars which drive both high traffic and high gross

margin dollars

— Buyers’ job here is to try and explode the assortment

e The H/L quadrant:

— Produces high gross margin dollars, but low units

— All SKU’s in this quadrant are kept because generating

high gross margin dollars is more important than

producing high units
