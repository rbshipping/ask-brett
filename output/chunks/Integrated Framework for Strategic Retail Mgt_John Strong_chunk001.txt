WHERE DOES STRATEGY COME FROM?

¢ Executive/Owner Values and Vision

¢ A Good Understanding of the External

Environment

¢ Our Results

WHAT IS STRATEGY?

Competitive Strategy is About Being Different

Deliberately Choosing a Different Set of

Activities to Deliver a Unique Mix of Value

Choosing to Perform Activities Differently

than Rivals do

Strategy is not Operational Effectiveness,

but...

Ten Ideas about Merchandise Buying/Planning

(with a couple sidebar comments)

1. Assortment planning / category management is

an ongoing activity that requires good systems.

2. Alow % of items drive business (20/20/60 rule)

3. Category roles

Traffic drivers

GM$ (put money in bank)

Relevance (offer)

Back to the Top Ten List....

4. |n-stock, in-stock, in-stock

5. Range reviews almost always bring large

benefits.

6. De-listing can change perception of

assortment.

7. You can't de-list your way to a good

GMROI...GMROI is a “fixable” concept.

Back to the Top Ten List....

8. Need a strategy to clear old or excess

inventory....

9. May need multiple assortment

strategies under one roof.

10. Consistent category management gets

harder over time.

Customer Analysis

¢ Best customers are worth more than you might

think

— For nonfood retailers: Typically, top 10% worth 40+%

sales, 50% margin; top 20% worth 75% sales, 80%

margin

— Half of NM sales from 100,000 shoppers

¢ Do you know who they are?

— Fundamentally different question than “target market”

or “fashion market segment”

— New opportunities to identify (or to define!)

5 Laws of Retail Merchandise/Operations

* Stores think buyers are stupid; buyers thinks stores are stupid.

* Both buyers and stores like merchandise; both buyers and stores

don’t like finance people — who see merchandise as a cost!

* Neither buyers nor store operations folks can imagine doing what

the other one does day in and day out.

* Planograms kinda sorta sometimes work, but they are better than

the alternative — which is often “let’s cram it in somewhere” or

“spread it out so it looks like we have more”

* It takes a while to get serious about merchandise

productivity...Growing businesses don’t worry about merchandise,

especially if they are opening new stores....but then all that stock

picks up speed, whacks you in the back of the head and knocks you

down...and more stable businesses “get used to it”...
