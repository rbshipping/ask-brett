INVENTORY & SALES STRATEGY – VIA LOOM

Team –

Today, I would like to share key principles for managing inventory and sales as a CEO. Think of yourself as the head of product—your decisions drive profitability.

Core Mindset

As CEO, sweat the details during sale periods. Inventory management isn’t passive—it’s active. Review daily, weekly, and monthly measures to forecast potential issues. Know your bad buys and what’s coming.

Weekly Reviews

Every week, review line by line. It’s okay to start with a high-level view, then deep dive into problem areas. Ask: What’s working? What’s not? What lessons are we learning, and how do we adjust our merchandising and buying decisions?

Margins and Buying Strategies

Always consider end-to-end margins. For example, if suspenders aren’t strong sellers, margins must be high to prepare for markdowns, buys should be low, and stock should sell out. Remember—it’s the final margin that counts, not the starting margin.

Sale Timing and Rules

Plan your SALE to finish by the end of January. Too early, and you risk under-buying and missing full-price sales. Avoid discounts over 50%—that’s a red flag. And ban flash sales—they erode value.

Preparation Steps

By early December, have your SALE list ready—not final pricing, but a clear view of how much product needs clearing. Consolidate stock early and move it where it needs to be before the SALE launches.

Country Level Decisions

Make overstock decisions by country, never globally. Use the last five weeks of sales data when planning coverage and pricing. Remember: SALE stock typically halves in sales each week.

Execution Tips

Move problem stock online—the biggest store. Keep SALE items at the front of physical stores. Markdowns must move the needle—dropping $40 to $35 won’t cut it.

Final Metrics

By end of January, measure final margins on key items like suspenders. With a 56% CODB, a 40% final margin means a loss—balance is critical.

Conclusion

Inventory management is about foresight and discipline. Apply these principles, and you’ll maximize margins while clearing stock efficiently.

Until the next time!
