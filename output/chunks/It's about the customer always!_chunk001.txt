CULTURE

• Why is the company culture so important?

– A culture is set of values that are important to our

success, a way of operating that makes the difference

between effective and mediocre performance.

– The culture is an essential standard for behaviour and

direction – when one is in place, it replaces rules,

ensures empowerment of team members, and guides

people in their decision-making.

THE CULTURE’S AFFECT

How does the culture affect the way we carry

out our jobs?

– Determines how we work together

– Determines how team members will treat each

other

– Determines the attitudes that bind us all

together

– It creates consistency

– Provides stability in an environment that is

constantly changing

– Team work from a commitment to the rules –

rather than from compliance

– Empowers team, replacing the need for rules

– Guides people in their decision making

To succeed, we must be passionate

about the customer and put the

customer first, always!

THE RELATIONSHIP WITH

YOUR “BOSS”

MUST BE TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY.

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION

• It can never be about what you’re doing – it

is about what your doing for the customer

• Remember, the customer’s perception and

evaluation of our service is far more valuable

than our own.

Customer satisfaction

doesn’t come from

companies…

It comes from individuals.

It comes from you!

Customer service…

not lip service

Customers need to feel

Question:

What is a moment of truth?

Answer:

An event in which a customer comes

into contact with any aspect of BNT

And thereby has an opportunity to

form an impression about us.

The point is that we must

concentrate our energy on

satisfying every single

customer, every single day

and every single time we

come into contact with them.

Be obsessed about

perfect service

In every discussion and

every meeting, ask

“how will this affect our

customer?”

How can we be

PERFECT SERVICE
