[Document: Jim Collins Question.docx]

Question #1: What is your best estimate of the percentage of the key seats on your bus (the bus you lead) that are filled with the right people for those seats?

80% of all seats filled with high-calibre people demonstrating right attitude, culture & competency.  Always looking to add to the team and improve, so room to go.

Question #2: After carefully reading the Turning the Flywheel monograph, what is your best first cut at the flywheel for the business unit you lead within BBRC International? Please seek to capture the flywheel as it reflects the reality of how your unit generates momentum today and that can serve as an architecture of momentum (with renewals and extensions) for the coming decades. (Note: If you are in a seat that is more aligned with BBRC International overall, rather than a business unit, then do this for BBRC International as an overall company.)

Question #3: What can your business unit be (or become) the best in the world at?

Return on equity

Question #4: What profit-per-x ratio best captures what drives the economic engine of your business – i.e., what is x?

Profit per $$ invested

Question #5: If your business unit were to execute brilliantly and renew/extend the flywheel with creativity and discipline, how far can it go over the next 15 years? Put another way, what might be a potential BHAG that your business could achieve in a 15-year timeframe?

July 17, 2030, $10billion in net tangible assets.
