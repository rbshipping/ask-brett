What I learned at Wal-Mart

I was reminded that measuring everything is the

easiest part, actually holding people

accountable to doing something with that

measurement to ensure that the business

improves is the key to measuring, the only

reason anything should be measured.

What I learned at Wal-Mart

I learned that Wal-Mart measure everything, not

to put too fine a point on it, I mean everything –

this was told to me by every single leader at

Wal-Mart (for the skeptical amongst you, they

each presented at different times and it came

out in different ways.) The response was

uniformly we measure everything and always

have.
