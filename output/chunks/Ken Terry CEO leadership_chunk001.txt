customers, competitors, trends, technology

* Want long therm employees who exhibit the "Company Way"

3 The Expertise approach

* Select and disseminate an area of expertise that will

be a source of competitive advantage

* Majority of time on improvement of the expertise

research, analysis of competitors products

* Share it across business borders

* Want subordinates with flexible minds, lack biases, and willing to

be immersed (indoctrinated) in the expertise.

4 The Box approach

* Creating, communicating, and monitoring an explicit set of controls

* Believe the Co success depends on consistent risk—free experience

* Lots of time on exceptions, results, and missed deadlines.

* Develop detailed policies and proceedures

and rewards to reinforce desired behaviours

* Value seniority in subordinates, hire from within.

5 The Change approach

* Must create an environment of continual reinvention.

even if such change produces anxiety and confusion leads to

some strategic mistakes, and hurts financially

* Control systems, written reports, planning cycles, policies and rules

do not seem to interest change agents

* Spent 75% of their time using speeches, meetings embracing change

* Want agressive independent subordinates who view their jobs

not as entitlements but as opportunities
