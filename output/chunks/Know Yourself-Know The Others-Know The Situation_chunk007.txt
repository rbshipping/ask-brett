blows an engine in this race

2 - Goodstone Tire has already committed to a

sponsorship of the car for $40,000.

A top five finish will mean a full season sponsorship next

year to the tune of $1 million plus incentives.

Withdrawing from this race means that $25,000 will have

to be returned to Goodstone and no sponsorship next

year.

Situational Characteristics

of

The Challenger Disaster

Time Pressure

Extreme Public Scrutiny

Lots of Smart People

Numbers vs Intuition

Framing

The managers viewed another delay as a financial loss:

“This shuttle thing will cost us 10 cents a share this year.”

therefore, they were not risk averse

Availability

It was easy to remember the last 24 events, all successes

Representativeness

They gave little credence to Paul Edwards, a mechanic

Anchoring

They fixed on their initial choice to launch

Overconfidence

The managers essentially scoffed at the engineers’

information that something might go wrong

Escalation of Commitment

They had postponed three times before;

this launch was tied to a Presidential address

Confirmation

They didn’t seek potentially disconfirming evidence

The Power of Numbers

Managerial Preferences for Action, not Inaction

Groupthink

Corrective Actions

* Search for Disconfirming Evidence

* Ask Outsiders (less influenced by

representativeness); Maximize Diversity

* Change Reference points (e.g., invoice,

not list price)
