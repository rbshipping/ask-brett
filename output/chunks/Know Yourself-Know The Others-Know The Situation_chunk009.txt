order to make decisions on staffing, advertising, information system

developments, purchasing, renovation, etc. All stores are similar in size and

merchandise selection. The main difference in their sales occurs because of

location and random fluctuations. Sales for 2004 were as follows:

Store 2004 2006

$12,000,000 | $

11,500,000

11,000,000

10,500,000

+ Your economic forecasting service has convinced you that

the best estimate of total sales increases between 2004 and

2006 is 10 percent (to 99,000,000). Your task is to predict

2006 sales for each store. Since your manager believes

strongly in the economic forecasting service, it is imperative

that your total sales are equal to $99,000,000.

Before we discuss your forecasts, let's consider a different

question.

* If you have a wonderful round of golf one day, what should

you expect of your next several rounds?

Regression to the Mean and Representativeness

* On average, golf scores drop after a really good round. Why?

Because it really was a good day: All of the errors you normally make

somehow disappeared, Unfortunately, those errors are probably part

of your normal game. So, your hopes shouldn't zoom too much after

any single success.

* This applies in other realms beyond golf. In terms of your forecasts:

The typical pattern of responses, + analysis: People estimate

2006 sales to be 1.1 times 2004 sales for each store. This should

only happen if you expect 2004 and 2006 sales to be perfectly

correlated.

Regression to the Mean and Representativeness

«It helps explain why companies are often disenchanted by the

performance of new recruits. If the company asks applicants to take

various tests, the company is likely to hire from among the top

scorers. But many of those top scorers may have just had a good

day on the test: Their actual performance level is something less than

this one test indicated.

«Thus, great rookies tend to have mediocre second years. (the

“sophomore jinx")

And firms that have outstanding profits one year tend not to do as

well the next.

» We understand the regression to the mean effect more easily in

others than we do in ourselves, and more easily with really extreme

performance. Thus, when Wilt Chamberlain scored 100 points in a

basketball game, not too many people thought he would do it again

the next game. But when our normal round of golf produces an 88

and we all of a sudden shoot 81, it's easy to think that maybe, just

maybe, we have improved.

Problem 3: A newly hired engineer for a computer firm in the Chicago

area has four years experience and good all-around qualifications.

When asked to estimate the starting salary for this employee, my

secretary (really knowing nothing about the profession, industry, or

Chicago) guessed an annual salary of $20,000. What is your estimate?

area has four years experience and good all-around qualifications.

When asked to estimate the starting salary for this employee, my

secretary (really knowing nothing about the profession, industry, or

Chicago) guessed an annual salary of $400,000. What is your

estimate?

Anchoring and Insufficient Adjustment : We tend to be affected by

numbers, even when the numbers aren't valid. They "anchor" our

thinking, and we tend to adjust away from them less than we should.

They affect our estimates, even when we should ignore them.

Typical pattern of responses and analysis: Responses are

influenced by the anchor. Thus, estimates are higher for the second

version than for the first version.

A survey study presented practicing auditors, pre-Enron

It is well known that many cases of management fraud go undetected

even when competent annual audits are performed. The reason, of

course, is that Generally Accepted Auditing Standards are not designed

specifically to detect executive-level management fraud. We are

interested in obtaining an estimate from practicing auditors of the

prevalence of executive-level management fraud as a first step in

ascertaining the scope of the problem.

* Based on your audit experience, is the incidence of significant

executive-level management fraud more than 10 in each 1000 firms

(that is, 1 percent) audited by Big Six accounting firms?

a. Yes, more than 10 b. No, less than 10

+ What is your estimate of the number of Big Six clients per 1,000 that

have significant executive-level management fraud?

in each 1000 Big Six clients have significant executive-level

management fraud

OR

+ Based on your audit experience, is the incidence of significant

executive-level management fraud more than 200 in each 1000

firms (that is, 20 percent) audited by Big Six accounting firms?

a. Yes, more than 200 b. No, less than 200

» What is your estimate of the number of Big Six clients per

1,000 that have significant executive-level management fraud?

in each 1000 Big Six clients have significant executive-

level management fraud

* The first version led to estimates of 16.52 instances of

executive fraud per 1000.

* The second version led to estimates of 43.11 instances of

executive fraud per 1000.
