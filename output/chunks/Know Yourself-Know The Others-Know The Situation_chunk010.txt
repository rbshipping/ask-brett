Overconfidence

+ People tend to be overconfident on tasks that range from

moderate to extreme difficulty. When our knowledge levels

drop, our confidence levels don't drop as fast as our

knowledge does.

« People tend to make a specific estimate, which acts as an

anchor for their confidence intervals, and they don't adjust

away from the anchor enough.

« Looking confident looks good. Looking as if you are not

confident doesn't look good.

* The Lesson: Look confident in public. Check to be sure

you should be confident in private, by asking yourself how

you could be wrong, and why.
