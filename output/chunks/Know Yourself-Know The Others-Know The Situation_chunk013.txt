“The first thing a professional gambler has to

do is make friends with himself. If you think

you've done something awfui, then go own

up to it. Give yourself an order to make sure

you don’t do anything like that again. And,

damn it, forget the whole thing. Then, get rid

of any excuses you may already have in

“Making peace with yourself is the first thing

a winner must do — at gambling or anything

else in life. Be good to people — treat them

nice and they'll want to gamble with you

again. Take care of yourself, neighbor, and

please don’t do no arguing. Because, like

I’ve always said, if there’s anything worth

arguing about, either bet on it or shut up.”
