TOPIC: Cost Reduction and Purchasing Optimization
SUMMARY: The text describes how the company discovered significant cost savings opportunities in its purchasing practices by conducting a detailed analysis of the prices paid for identical gloves across different factories.
KEYWORDS: purchasing, cost optimization, price variation, data analysis, change management

own negotiated price. The same glove could cost $5 at one factory and $17 at another.

$5.00 or even $17.00 may not seem like much money, but we buy A LOT of gloves, and

this was just one example of our purchasing problem. When I examined what he had found,

even I couldn’t believe how bad it was.

The student collected the gloves, literally all 424. He put each in a baggie with the

price on it and the factory it was used in. Then he sorted the bags by division in the firm and

type of glove. So you had big stacks of welding gloves that were used at all the different

factories in one of our businesses.

We took all this and put it in our boardroom one day. Then we invited all the

division presidents to come visit the room. What they saw was a large, expensive table,

normally clean or with a few papers, now stacked high with gloves. Our executives would

stare at this for a minute. They would say, ‘we buy all these different kinds of gloves?’

Well, as a matter of fact, yes we do. ‘Really??’ Yes, really. Then they would walk around

the table. Most, I think, looked for the gloves that their factories were using. They could see

the prices. They would look at two gloves that seemed exactly alike, yet one was marked

$3.22 and the other $10.55.

It’s a rare event when these people don’t have anything to say. But that day, they just

stood with their mouths gaping.

This demonstration quickly gained notoriety. The gloves became part of a traveling

road show. They went to every division. They went to dozens of plants. Many, many people

had the opportunity to look at the stacks of baggies. The road show reinforced at every level

of the organization a sense of ‘this is how bad it is’.

Through more research, again done quickly and inexpensively by one of our

students, we discovered what some of our competition were doing. The ‘competitive

benchmarking’ was added to the road show. As a result, we were given a mandate for

change. People would say ‘we must act now,’ which of course we did, and saved a great

deal of money that could be used in much more sensible ways.

Even today, people still talk about the glove story.

What was the one key learning I received from this presentation? (Something new

or reinforced)

What implications does it have for me / my organisation?

Who else should know this?

How will I share it with him / her/ them (include a time line)?

Part IV

The Power to Astound:

Leading to Win in a Time of

Accelerating Speed and

Great Turbulence.

Five Degrees of Change

. Little change: Making goods

and services with long product

life cycles.

Continuous improvement:

Constant incremental changes

in products and ways of

operating.

3. Non-incremental change within

businesses: In addition to 2,

regularly introducing new product

lines and significant improvements

in how to run the business.

4. Whole new businesses: In addition

to 2 and 3, inventing not just new

product lines but new businesses.

5. Whole new business models: In

addition to 2, 3, and 4, inventing not

just new businesses but new

economic and organizational

models.

Winning in the past meant

handling well #1 and #2

degrees of change.

That required

ereat management.

Winning now in most

industries means handling 1,

2, and 3 degrees well.

That requires both

management and visionary

leadership.

Sustaining success in the new

economy means handling all

5 degrees well.

That will require good

management, visionary

leadership, and a form of

leadership that can unleash

huge amounts of intellectual,

physical and emotional energy.

Youth

“Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind; it is not a matter of rosy cheeks, red

lips and supple knees; it is a matter of the will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the

emotions; it is the freshness of the deep springs of life.

Youth means the temperamental predominance of courage over timidity, of the

appetite for adventure over the love of ease. This often exists in a man of sixty more than a

boy of twenty. Nobody grows old merely by a number of years. We grow old by deserting

our ideals.

Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul. Worry, fear,

self-distrust bows the heart and turns the spirit back to dust.

Whether sixty or sixteen, there is in every human being’s heart the lure of wonder, the
