LEADING CHANGE

ACCELERATION GUIDE

Our environment today is characterized by the some of the most profound and high impact changes,

coming at us faster and faster than ever before. This combination of the velocity of change and the impact

of the changes sets up a unique condition that most change leaders have never worked through.

APPLYING THE KOTTER CHANGE ADAPTABILITY FRAMEWORK

The Change Adaptability Model is an easy-reference guide to understand how individuals are impacted by

change.

1. We become accustomed to doing things a certain way.

2. The environment around us gradually changes, and –

3. we adapt – often unconsciously and subconsciously...

4. Until the changes we experience outpace our ability to adapt!

THE FORMIDABLE CHANGE POWER

Networks are the most under leveraged asset during any change. The potential of networks to dramatically

change how work is done is frequently ignored. This is a tragedy, as it squanders a natural asset that could

be a powerful accelerator for change.

THE FAQ'S TO LEADING RAPID CHANGE

POST LEADING RAPID CHANGE WEBINAR | Q+A

We extend our sincerest thanks to the participants who posed such terrific questions during our webinar.

Below are our compiled our responses and, as always, look forward to continuing the conversation.

What do you think about employee involvement in leading rapid change? by Monhesea

Employee involvement is essential to leading rapid change. It's the network that powers a change effort

over time. Without many people demonstrating new behaviors, contributing ideas, and working toward

the same objective, many change efforts never fully get off the ground.

How do you achieve positive engagement without people feeling intimidated by your

enthusiasm? by Natasha

Authenticity is key. Unrelenting enthusiasm can sound hollow or out-of-touch if you fail to

acknowledge the real barriers that exist. Having a common "North Star" to point to, even in times of

real challenge, helps frame positivity to a focus on possibility.

Organization restructuring is what a lot of companies are going through. How can we create a positive

feeling from such a hard change? by Shaima

We've written about topic a number of times – here and here are two of the resources written by our

experts.

What first action will you recommend to a school principal who is wondering how to lead in the

current pandemic environment? by Mohammed

We endlessly empathize with you as parents of students in both virtual and live environments. You and your

colleagues in education are experiencing a masterclass level of rapid change leadership skill-building. Step 1

of John Kotter's 8-Step Process for Leading Change is to Create a Sense of Urgency. It's fair to say that

urgency already exists for you in this moment in time. Yet what may be driving behaviors is false urgency:

when everything (and thus nothing) is important and attention is splintered across countless priorities.

What can result is a lot of activity – and not necessarily results. You can help to quiet the noise by making

explicit what matters most right now: what are people to be most urgent about? Be specific. This will help to

calm the frenetic pace that accompanies false urgency and channel a truer, more sustainable sense of

urgency that empowers people to drive impact right where it matters most.

THE FAQ'S TO LEADING RAPID CHANGE

POST LEADING RAPID CHANGE WEBINAR | Q+A CONTINUED

Do you have some experiences of rapid change in the governments? by Helle

Kotter has had a number of clients over the years in the public sector. One such example is

described here.

Measuring change is challenging. What would you recommend as a qualitative metric to

capture change? by Zoe

Change can indeed be a nebulous thing to measure. Within the Kotter consulting practice we have a

Culture Change Index tool that we use with clients to benchmark change readiness at the onset of a

transformation effort, as well as progress further along in the journey. We also look to Step 6 of Dr.

Kotter's 8-Step Process for Leading Change – generate short-term wins. Tracking the wins that are

shared and celebrated, particularly in aggregate, provides a dashboard-type of view of all that has been

accomplished within a change effort: behaviors that have changed, innovations that have scaled from one

site to many, new ways of working that are being demonstrated. How these wins are collected and shared

varies from organization to organization, but they become proof points of progress. In turn, they help
