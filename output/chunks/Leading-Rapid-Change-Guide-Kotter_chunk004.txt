Can you share more about the formula? by Helle

An interesting article can be found here and thorough, and detailed technical discussion

Network Science can be found here.

Can you share an example? by Mary

Let's say you have 100 people in your organization/team. In a typical hierarchy, there are few

defined relationships - the manager may have seven supervisors/direct reports, and in turn each

direct report has 12-13 people reporting to them. You can map this out fairly easily and see that there

are a number of 1:1 relationships. Being generous, there may be 13 relationships for each supervisor

and each supervisor has a relationship with the manager. The supervisors will also likely have

relationships between themselves. However you'll probably find that you max out at around 120

connection points. However, if everyone in the network were connected to everyone else, you would

have a total of 4,950 relationships - i.e. (100 * 99)/2. This is a massive (4,000%) increase in the

number of relationships - and this is what is so powerful about the network.
