And you know the version two of the wall bay in Levisa where it's got the fabric back.

And it's got the slot with the golden pegs, right?

I wonder if you have any of those left in your China warehouse.

We take one.

We put it on one of our wall bays.

And then shelves on another.

Now you're thinking.

Now you're thinking.

Because it's only one.

If there's only one part of the store, that's easier.

I was in the mindset that you wanted to.

Originally eventually we will.

But if you're happy for me to do one part that I can manage.

In a few weeks right now, like to get to get this now.

Yeah.

I don't know what I want.

Yeah.

And what I know I want is that we are going to be.

Doing a lot of experiments.

Okay.

And testing, trialing, innovating.

And watching it.

And seeing what happens.

What I know we need.

Is speed.

So what I'm really saying on this one is there's no way known.

We are going to wait until the 24th of November.

No.

That can't happen.

Therefore.

Thanks guys.

Carry on with that.

But don't mean stop that.

No.

But what I mean is.

We need products.

And we need it.

Displayed.

In an environment with the signage.

When I know I can get.

I know and get signage.

Now you're thinking.

So if we pull those.

Yes, we do have those wallways.

Yes, we do have those.

They'll.

Of course, be sitting in multiple places around the world.

They're all held.

We keep like 20 stores.

In stock any one time.

Now they're.

They're certainly being poll and if they're not, they'll, they'll be in China.

So that's.

Good conversation to in 30 minutes to get to an action point here is.

We need to get those.

And.

We don't want to.

We definitely don't want to be.

Sorry, I don't mean we don't want to be.

Maybe it'll end up being that way.

We have a competitor.

That you just saw open.

They're doing prongs, right?

But they're a Levisa competitor.

They're directly Levisa, right?

Yes.

Now, maybe it is that we're going to be.

We're going to start the visa and.

Part that.

That the next level up.

What we.

What we know is that there's a customer there that wants to.

Are you put it again?

So well the other day is that.

There's somebody that can't go into Levisa.

But she needs to go somewhere.

Because Levisa is just too down and dirty.

And.

We'll try the prongs.

But why we're thinking about the golden prongs.

Well, we.

We need to go.

Well, what's the different way to present this product?

Yeah.

How do we make sure that we use.

You know, we don't use as much.

Carding, you know, maybe all our.

Our wrist isn't on cards.

It's on.

Side hanging.

So that it.

That is a different level.

I only foresee earrings being on card.

Everything else will have a swing tag.

For our.

I have.

The.

I'll walk you through the store design on Tuesday.

That's like ready.

Pretty much.

Just minus the detail.

I can.

So I'm clear.

That's makes it easier for me.

That I can take a part of the store and just do it while

simultaneously doing this because I still think it's important.

We do this.

And.

And I'll just.

I'll just get it done.

That's fine.

And.

Yeah, that's fine.

I'm.

I can do that.

Actually, the weird thing is the longest thing won't be the product.

It will be the tag.

And.

Get in it and then reworking it and putting it on.

Yeah.

But we can get that at the same time as for the next one to two

weeks, we'll wait for the sample.

So it will come in play.

And then in the meantime, we'll go to the wholesaler.

We'll get a wall.

And we'll just test it in red and white city.

Then while we're doing this on the other end.

That's fine.

What this takes it is that.

And then the.

And then we're going to see how much more people are going to do with the

work.

And then you're going to see what we're going to do.

Because we're going to have to.

Because what we do is we work with all these big guys right.

Yeah.

Have.

Have all this.

It's nonsense.

Things like.

I'll give you an example if you're on a movie set.

And you're a prop guy.

You have to make the prop.

Yeah.

On the spot.

Right.

Now it's usually expensive, usually ridiculous.

waiting around because the directors come in and go that doesn't work change that I want this

and I want that made I want it done by tomorrow and all these trainees come in and

and they're all given fancy names but they're just

ladies in them in them when they're doing this stuff because they can't go

oh yeah okay sorry we'll have to put back the opening of the show until

it's 24 November because that will take us for you know the people that we work with

are people that are professional do things everything has to run through a process and has to

get into the queue and what we need to do is find somebody that can come in and go right I need

this and this they go down to the local hardware it's 10 times more expensive yeah yeah but

get it done we're gonna yeah that's fine we can do that um we'll do it uh yeah we're definitely um

I'm definitely gonna need some extra help the um product team are just not

just hard work it's just hard work no they're just they're just not cut out for it
