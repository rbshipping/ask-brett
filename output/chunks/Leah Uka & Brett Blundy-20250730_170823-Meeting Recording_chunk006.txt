get into the queue and what we need to do is find somebody that can come in and go right I need

this and this they go down to the local hardware it's 10 times more expensive yeah yeah but

get it done we're gonna yeah that's fine we can do that um we'll do it uh yeah we're definitely um

I'm definitely gonna need some extra help the um product team are just not

just hard work it's just hard work no they're just they're just not cut out for it

they're just it's just bizarre to me there's no one wants to do anything um everything has a problem

everything is a problem so uh we'll get I'll get it sorted we'll get I'll get it done

it's fine we'll do it we'll do both simultaneously and keep testing while we're doing this in

the longer run that's good as long as you're happy for me to spend the money I'll do it

I think it's too far away if we wait until there's two problems with this timeline

the first one is it's not a test it's a full blown this is what we're doing and this is this is

the order the second problem is it's just

with we think about that's five months away that will be another half a million pounds of

it will be a big investment yeah now I would rather say you've got a if I said to you've got

50,000 pounds go fix up the store with a with a guy and he's buddy who's

I want this I want that and I want tomorrow and and cover this and you can do stuff it's

prop like um call it a hop up but I don't I never I don't like

I don't know but this is what we're going to do bang it's going to be there and

that would you be expensive just to to do that but compare that to

what we're going to have to do in between here because you're ordering for all stores and we're

going to redo all stores we're not going to do that no we're we're just going to do one store

now what's happened is we can't order one store of stuff through the Levisa supply chain because

it's just not set up for for that right so we'd use STI and no I'm talking about both

product and pictures and fittings right because every Levisa supplier is geared for volume

right price the only way you get great price is volume and and well I'm not interested in

price at the moment I'm just interested in in in terms of margin we're interested in we want

it we need to put this at this price and we need to find the product that's going to

resonate because I can't believe it's it's it's super difficult that we've got

this so wrong like so wrong I mean look at the sales yesterday we're even on sale and we can't

I know it's almost like we can't we can't give this product away

and that scares me a bit it scares me a lot actually because of like how the how could we get

this so wrong that well I think the product team and I'm not the right team Kelly's great she's

great but she's not right and that was very clear to me in China because if I wasn't there

they would have ordered all the wrong product again again and I had to like

like basically I ended up picking all the product and because everything again I was like

guys like if we're getting this product you have to think about the season you have to think

about this you have to think about that this is too similar we've got product like this

they don't see they are picking for themselves not the customer and it's just it's a constant pushback

so my concern is great now that I've got involved and got this product coming hopefully as many

scusers we can get why could I have a product team I can't trust to do this

moving forward and we're paying them a hell of a lot of money to just sit there and organize what I

pick so I know why that product isn't working yeah it's not our customers want their product

but unfortunately the delusion is is there they still don't think the product is the problem

well we're selling product now for 14 pounds and we can't give it away the customers doesn't want it

yeah that's what in the last 10 days right that's what's come home to me because I was genuinely

have you guys even gone on sale have you guys well that's we have got team going out into the center

to bring people in we have big red sale sale sale 60% off we're selling things that were

50 60 pound for 14 pounds and customers still don't want it and I know why so styles it's not right

so let's move on from that so I'm going to you're going to set that time up hopefully Pio is

available then remember Pio has a very big job like a huge job you're going to ring sage in

yeah I need her number if you don't mind sure or shall I reach out to Julia to set me up with her

hey hey Rude will you send find sage in's details send it to Leah

her email address her phone number her whatsapp sage in and we so I think you've probably already

come to this conclusion but I've looked at that I haven't seen the execution at store level

in terms of whether we've done sale right because you have to do sale right but the first thing I
