yeah I need her number if you don't mind sure or shall I reach out to Julia to set me up with her

hey hey Rude will you send find sage in's details send it to Leah

her email address her phone number her whatsapp sage in and we so I think you've probably already

come to this conclusion but I've looked at that I haven't seen the execution at store level

in terms of whether we've done sale right because you have to do sale right but the first thing I

want to do on Tuesday is look at the sale specifically sale product but it sounds like you've

already done it yeah that's the big shot to me that we've gone on sale and we're just not moving

anything that tells me it's it's it's product so let's just figure that out so

what you're saying is that we've just done stuff that just nobody wants

we're we're we're off trend no you're not saying that the customers saying that now

because our situation's worse that's normally when you go on sale and have aggressive markdowns

your your volume goes up it doesn't go down and as far as I can see the only place that's

gone up is online everything everything else has gone down and our margin is horrific

horrendous yeah it's not to get worse because I've added more lines in and gone more aggressive

so I need to get a stock all right now remember you're supposed to talk these things through

with me okay you're only you know here's what I'm thinking here's what I'm doing here's what

the numbers are saying you know you can throw it all up on the screen here with shared screen and

uh remember we'll go see uh yeah this is true um do you want me to talk it through

if you know quickly if you've got five minutes to talk about it or no yeah I didn't know

I'm not sure I do because I want to get through I want to get through some of this

other stuff that you've got I can get get it ready for you for Tuesday we don't have to do anything

about it until Tuesday we'll keep going as we are I don't mind you doing what you think you need

to do so don't hold up for Tuesday you still have three years worth of cover yeah okay and I'm just

thinking we have one shot to clear this as sale without us looking like we're in trouble to the

landlord and what is uh what's our what's our merge plan is name Rebecca and what is Rebecca saying

about some of these mark downs that uh maybe you could ask Rebecca to put together a report

yeah that she's giving me one I can share it with you right send it just don't let's not do it

now just send it to me and I'll all right I'll try to get to it yeah before we talk again

tomorrow yeah

RFID yeah um so about to so levita are now piloting RFID so we're at a stage now where we can start

getting uh start again and get that pricing and the time frame on that um no point in us doing

anything with that until we until and if we relaunch we'll relaunch we change everything we're

just pushing that back now remembering it on the basis that we're going to get this right yeah I

don't want us to stop doing because what happens if you stop you lose the momentum then

ah we launch and we've still got bullshit issues which sucks the energy out of everybody yeah um

store design I think everything we have to do we have to work with people that can move faster

and you have to get out of the we're in a good place with that I think you'll be happy on Tuesday

okay good can you send me anything in advance pitches uh the concepts yeah uh

and then so you're of the mind that we need we need new product people

yeah all right and given the fact that killing caterer experience and they're seeing this

map down product that's not working are you involving them in yeah and the

been one ear and out the other the them is not the issue uh and I can understand now why they think

like that considering what I know about what they did in their previous roles um

yeah well that from my understanding what they were telling me is they had they design like a

small range of product they would sell it on and they wouldn't really get involved too much on

the cell through or anything like that that's certainly out of sight out of mind so there's

no comeback on them with that there's no having to rethink certain lines um and so it makes

sense to me I'm like well of course like you you don't sit there and see the cell through to you

you've sold it on it you're on to the next um and they're only selling small lines to Tesco and to

M&S whereas not their main core business so well it's not small I don't know I mean no

but it's not they're not responsible for a whole retail store of jewelry yeah um and they're not

responsible for the data that sits behind it yeah I'm not sure that that's I don't think that's

not true because best sellers are best sellers and they have to be a best seller in they've even got

harder taskmasters sometimes because Tesco for example they measure everything if you think

the visa does gemmer on gemmer off in the UK gross margin return on meter but turn on square foot

Tesco brutal on that you don't you don't if you don't sell X amount from that space
