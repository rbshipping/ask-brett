responsible for the data that sits behind it yeah I'm not sure that that's I don't think that's

not true because best sellers are best sellers and they have to be a best seller in they've even got

harder taskmasters sometimes because Tesco for example they measure everything if you think

the visa does gemmer on gemmer off in the UK gross margin return on meter but turn on square foot

Tesco brutal on that you don't you don't if you don't sell X amount from that space

your ass um but I'm not sure Kelly and Kate were really no no but they would have been getting

feedback and they would have been you know because of things have to sell they have to be on trend

they have to be wanted now it's a different it's a different want so I don't I think that's too much

of an excuse um maybe like if I had to keep anyone it would be Kelly um but she we just need more

people with retail experience we need to to call what we've got and we need retailers and people

have a bit more come like wider commercial experience yeah okay as of right now we could not

send those guys alone to source products yeah yeah okay that's the problem okay sage in is the

the person you should talk to when we talk to peer put that on the agenda peer who have we got

um we did interview a girl that's at one of the places that was of the visa um Louise

where did she go she went which one was she yeah now she was she's definitely interested um but

wanted to be in charge um now she might be the right person for a small

uh because to all reports she was she was a good product person I don't I didn't know but um but

she was definitely looking um because people who are ambitious asked for you know they're not

they're not going anywhere um so maybe it's worth

re picking up that seriously where that leads us um don't be doing uh you can talk to me about why

can't we have this person at Louise or why can't we have that person but do not do anything in

the background that will cause drama nowhere um all right get the say the other reason to have

sage in involved is because the board are quite agitated uh okay because we've got this so wrong

they'll be more agitated because the question that they will ask me is so Brett what happens in February

we have to carry another three million four million five million pounds of losses

and what if this doesn't work Brett um and that's the right question to ask of course I'll tell

them I've already asked all those questions to myself but um there is uh they have a

duty to all the shareholders and they will voice that they want it they want to hear the answers

and that's going to happen in three weeks time right so one of the things uh to have sage in

involved she'll um who's that not going to cause a concern like if I'm asking her about

also no no she'll love it but no she will if you ring up and say sage in Brett tell me to call you

um I need your help and advice and can I tell you what we we're at she will love it

okay and I mean love it okay no it's not an issue at all so uh the board meeting that we have

it is um on the 26th so I lied to you it's uh it's actually nearly a month away a month um

August 20th okay uh and sage in very much the product person everything you talk to

about it you already have some ideas in her head um she will definitely how do we get product quicker

um do you have any people knowledge that she might have you know we might there might be some

people available contract um that she knows uh that doesn't destroy the levisa uh team that she

could say listen I this person here is just who you know who you need and it's American but the

come out of the London for a month or something and we'll do you we're exploring just

explore and then I'll talk to her as well okay uh so style situation for Tuesday

as the big issue for me is what the it's like wait what we've reduced some of these things by more

than half and what's happening so I want to see the sale situation the sale setup the sales numbers

this uh line by line so Rebecca has to break it into sale and full price and then we run I want

to run a session on sale or also I want to keep looking at the full price stuff is

anything changed from that point of view no no and so it's sell through rates all all that stuff

just on yeah sell and and newsboard design yeah and um how's Zoe good she's great she's doing good

she's on board she's very on board and she's very excited for the changes um I've got her tasks

at the moment we've making sure our pierces are fully competent and trained appropriately um so she's

on it piercing still holding up it is do you still get the odd complaint not as many as we did

but when we do get a complaint it's a big complaint yeah okay with her us margin how's she going

he's on holiday fuck yeah Peter agreed it earlier in the year how long he's away until the eleventh

of August it's killing me off he's been off already for three four days two and a bit weeks he's
