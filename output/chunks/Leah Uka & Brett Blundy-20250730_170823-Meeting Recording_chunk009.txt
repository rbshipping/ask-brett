[Document: Leah Uka & Brett Blundy-20250730_170823-Meeting Recording.txt]

at the moment we've making sure our pierces are fully competent and trained appropriately um so she's

on it piercing still holding up it is do you still get the odd complaint not as many as we did

but when we do get a complaint it's a big complaint yeah okay with her us margin how's she going

he's on holiday fuck yeah Peter agreed it earlier in the year how long he's away until the eleventh

of August it's killing me off he's been off already for three four days two and a bit weeks he's

off full yeah okay so in terms of store I got ten on board if I need ten I can use them right

but everyone's good otherwise all right so how are we going to get you're going to get

pier sorted and then we're going to think about some fiction fittings from Levisa the fabric

covered ones yeah cool say Jen oh so um test keep testing the stores the corners of the store

while we simultaneously do this prompt yeah we can we can pretty much go what do we got to do

his his the thing is how I want it to look okay now let's make that look uh that way I

doesn't matter I know redding is trading you know a bit better but it doesn't matter if we do okay

let's do you know the first because it's a smaller store we do the half of the you know left hand

side wall or right hand side wall right and just make that look different yeah customers can

walk in and they go okay that's there over there I don't want that but this is my you know we do

that all the time and I'll agree to do that all the time okay and you can do that with

featuring you can do that with signage you can do that with color you can I'm enough to tell you

all that didn't yeah now that's good that's good we're on to make go that's we're on to make go

there right yeah all right what else that's it um just need to get all this going

but I know it's a success otherwise I'm happy with the product we picked out and I'm confident it's

going to sell I look forward to seeing it yeah and the next problem we have is that I'm actually away

oh that's probably not the end of the world right because if I'm what I'm thinking is if

because you're going to be away after next week for a few weeks I know I can really

three weeks on Singapore and Kettle stations and Lavisa and Liais and best and less and it's my

longest trip of the year actually okay well I can be testing the store and sending you kind of

updates um while simultaneously doing this for the the the bigger thing for the one store um so I'll

keep testing or just get I need to find out who I need to speak to at Lavisa about this

wall bay fixture while Marchins not here but let's get this let's get this on the

um agenda for Friday yeah and Pia will uh but it'll be her name is Tanya oh I know Tanya okay I've

met her Tanya she's the Irish one yeah she's great um but it will really just be here's what we

want you go into the store and take a picture and say this is what I want is how many I want

and um I don't know any this for sure but it will be sitting in power and the reason it's sitting

in power is because they never know how many stores they're going to open so we anticipate

and remember we're opening 150 stores a year yeah and so it's always there's always more than than we

need so that shouldn't that shouldn't be any issue at all now think about that being in terms of

some of that fixture in feeling you could take and we can read February we you can yeah we can

paint it we can you think about that pop up that props you know yeah movie sets well

oh that color doesn't work redo it um that that needs to to be this fabric covered in that fabric

right now to get a ginger broke if you have to do it across thousands of stores but

yeah you can read also refabric read this read that go and get that you know um it's hilarious what

happens in those sorts of scenes in like Saturday night I'm talking about things like Saturday night

live right they do props every single week right in a studio they have to fill it out put it in and

yeah and yeah yeah and so everything can give me down it's just a matter of what's the kind of cost

and the cost is not costs are always the enemy but they're not the issue for us we've got to find

and we just got to do that right and we've got to find what's resonating now we have a

we have have you heard about Harley and Harper yeah so they're they're aggressive but there are others

particularly in Singapore and you know peers are aware of you know all these things now they're not

much different to not much different to Larissa or talk but they certainly pushed a little higher

but then they're more a copy of Larissa so and we know that they're working right so in the UK

just to let you know Larissa in the UK is the second best territory that we have

and the same situation is there is a need that you know the fact that we have double stores in so
