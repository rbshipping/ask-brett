particularly in Singapore and you know peers are aware of you know all these things now they're not

much different to not much different to Larissa or talk but they certainly pushed a little higher

but then they're more a copy of Larissa so and we know that they're working right so in the UK

just to let you know Larissa in the UK is the second best territory that we have

and the same situation is there is a need that you know the fact that we have double stores in so

many places the reason Westfield put in that copy is because they don't want to Larissa stores

yeah just doesn't make any sense from their point of view so they want to be able to to try to

bring other players in they're glad to have them so that they can get rid of one of the Larissa stores

when yeah it rolls around because they don't want you know it's particularly Westfield London now

Strafffield they even don't want it but yeah they've got no choice because it demands that

yeah so think about that but it's that next level up so we can do all that all right you're on it

you're a champion I appreciate you thinking about this you're proving to be very good at this

thanks I'm frustrated because if it was up to me I would do it all myself and just get it done

tonight but it's like it's people are the hardest thing and you obviously know that and I do

know that but it's even harder when they just constantly push back with problems yeah so what

you've got to do and of course welcome to leadership yeah yeah that's this inside joke with all

people and that run run business sort of lead businesses up wasn't for the frigging people this

would be easy right and it's true remember I say starting a business the hardest thing you'll ever

do because everybody's against you right it's it feels like everybody's against you yeah

and so what my little tip for you is don't let it get you down first of all that's the strength you

got to push back on it and that's not easy to easy to say hard to do don't lose your shit and

that's where culture and motivation comes in and you've got to start to communicate right so

your trip for example you've got to start every meeting with we went there we've got this happening

it's going to be great but don't do it in some wobbly bullshit way but you've got to keep everybody

involved yeah and have the wins what's good what's going on here's where we're at this is this is

what the future looks like and that motivation carries people and it helps suppress and of course

those people that are against you got to get rid of that's that's because there's some people just

you know matter how much you yeah so I yeah I have like weekly meeting had on this morning and we

talked exactly about that with the whole company and I don't think it's that certain people aren't

are against me I think what it is is actually I've just realized it's actually very rare to find

people that are open to other things outside of their kind of their line of work so thinking

outside the box is actually quite difficult for people to do and so that's the pushback it's

like they can't comprehend it they you know just even like reworking tags you know I was like well

we're just getting to send the samples to us and we'll bloody do it it's like one or two pieces

right and it's like they just can't they just like no that's not going to work and you're just like

it is just trust me but you know it's that sort of thing it's not they're not on board they just

can't they just can't compute I know so there we go yeah you know I know yeah and we just

spoke about it there on the product okay I can't wait to know them but what else now here is

an excellent executive yeah and but you can't think outside of that because she just can't

she's not entrepreneur now she's partly entrepreneur or she and she's very ambitious and she

desperately wants to do a great job they're all great characteristics but ask her to go and

find wholesalers and that but it's like that's too hard and I've got this other job to do

yeah exactly so horse that's of course it's remember don't and also don't get cranky because they

don't know no they don't want to be this CEO they don't want to be the leader they don't want

to get all revved up I got it you got to find that

you got to find the people that balance yeah yeah you do need doers we need people that enjoy

a bit of chaos because this is a startup and it's nothing's perfect yeah you need

or you need that sort of stuff but you most you've got to keep them going you've got to keep

them for all others yeah and they've got to believe in the course yeah yeah okay

got it I'm all over it I'll get it all right thank you talk to you tomorrow bye
