Thank you.

And as the general side, one of the first things that I noticed when I came in before font is because it's not red. It's a shame that these aren't. I know it doesn't look pretty, but this isn't a red color.

So it's because I know because I know that when we look at the fact that it was 70 and I know it says sales, but it doesn't, it looks too big.

You know what I mean? Like, for the customer sees the savings. So that's what I'm trying to look at is the savings.

So, for example, I've got this beautiful display. This is 28 pounds. How do I find out how much? If everyone wants to know what they're saving, they're to do that.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Bye-bye.

Bye-bye.

Yeah. Hello. I'm coming. I'm coming.

all good you okay

I'm

perfect

I'm jet lagged

I'm all good

I'm all good no whinging

I've missed that face

okay

what's going on

waterproof really good

so

top 30 styles across

the jewels brand 26

top are all waterproof

sellers

12

lines have completely sold out

4 of them have sold out twice

went to

Paris

twice

so we

had

we put the original stock

out then we had another ship we sold out

within 2 days and we put we had another

shipment come in we replaced

it and it sold

out again and so when we were in

Paris yesterday we've just bought

4 more different variations and more

stock and we're putting that in next week

tell me that's that again I've got to

write this down so

so

you sold

12 lines have completely sold out

yeah

four of those lines have sold out twice

so

go back at the start you said something about

out of all the lines we've sold 20

top 30

set styles

across

all store count

waterproof are dominating and ranking the top 26

styles

yeah

outside of piercing

but that just in

what city

yes

right

and that's outside of

even though some of the other stuff is marked down

for decorsage

yeah

yesterday

so 12 lines have completely sold out

four of those lines sold out twice

so how that's happened is we bought stock like the gold bangle for example

wholesale

we put it out

then we had another shipment from another store come with a similar bangle

and it's sold

we put that out and it's sold out again

so

when we went to Paris yesterday and the day before we bought a whole new load of

variations and

more stock and we're putting that in

when it

we're putting that in

dominating is wrist wear

and the exciting thing is

is

our wrist wear is our most expensive line

in that cut in waterproof

and

and

red in

is selling really well

which is a

like a trend product

so that's really really positive

then it's necklaces

so a pearl bead necklace is the top selling

neck wear item

and a heart chain

which you know is all the classic styles

and then it's rings

and then it's earrings

so

really good

yesterday

waterproof did 26% of total sales again at White City

so

it's just

I can't wait

so Tuesday night

the plan is

me and the whole team

are going into White City after trade

so in the night time

we're taking all the sell product down

putting it all back into the storage

and the cupboards for fulfillment

because it has

yeah

no

why not

we've just got whole stores worth of product

no I'm with you

100% with you

this is what you've got to do

you can't put it into the drawers

right

you've got to shift it

to all the other stores

so you either bring it back to the DC

and to the warehouse

but you cannot put it in the drawers

because

we have to

but what about

online fulfillment

yeah

you can online fulfill

from

it's no longer a store

okay

that you can online fulfill from

then that makes life much easier

because

it means that we won't have to take time

in finding every unit

and putting it in

okay

perfect

great plan

well you will

the warehouse will have to do that

so

you've got to

yes

box it all up

but us in White City won't

White City

you're

the plan is

which I'm very supportive of

and excited about

is you're going to

we're now

got rid of

all the

other stuff

right

whatever we call that

high priced

bespoke

designed

we're now going to

put in

everything

mark 2

2.0

whatever we're calling it

2.0

right

so that means

you don't want to see

any of that

product

ever

ever again

no

apart from piercings

so

yeah

so whatever we're keeping

everything else

goes back

otherwise you just

confuse yourself

yeah

nobody

nobody else will
