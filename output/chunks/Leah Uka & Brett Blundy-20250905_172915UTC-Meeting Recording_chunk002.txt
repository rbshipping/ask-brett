but us in White City won't

White City

you're

the plan is

which I'm very supportive of

and excited about

is you're going to

we're now

got rid of

all the

other stuff

right

whatever we call that

high priced

bespoke

designed

we're now going to

put in

everything

mark 2

2.0

whatever we're calling it

2.0

right

so that means

you don't want to see

any of that

product

ever

ever again

no

apart from piercings

so

yeah

so whatever we're keeping

everything else

goes back

otherwise you just

confuse yourself

yeah

nobody

nobody else will

ever get to it

out of sight

out of mind

so you've got to

bring it back

into the distribution

centre

and it's got to be

counted back into

the inventory

so all this is

tricky

but

no

actually much easier

or you can

transfer it

to other stores

immediately

so you can actually

go

you can divide it up

if you've got five

of these

you can just have

a box

and that's probably

even a better way

to think about it

to

you know

the sales

rates

of

Reading

you know

sales

if you've got five

you give two to

Reading

one to

and you just

pop them there

and then they can be

transferred

directly

yeah

across

so you don't have to

waste time

and money

and productivity

going through

the DC

now that's less

effective

because you always

want to draw

from the DC

to be accurate

but we're not

really looking

for accuracy

at this moment

so

think about

those two things

you can either

bring it back

to the DC

or

you know

get six

or seven

allocation

boxes

and you can

just

allocate it

right there

all of it

just bang

bang

and not

I don't mean

one for one

because

you know

Reading

of course

sells

three times

as much

as

yeah

right

yeah

okay

so I'll do

that

and then

Tuesday night

everything

in that store

will become

all the newness

the panels

are arriving

Monday

they've just

gone through

customs

so that's

good

the

we've

managed

to

smuggle

in

as much

as we

could

smuggled

in

from

Paris

two to

three pieces

of everything

and then the

rest of it's

had to be

shipped

so you're

a smuggling

you're a smuggling

now

we smuggled

some

but we

managed to get

the rest

shipped

and half

of it's

already

arrived

today

so the

girls

have been

carding

it

while I've

been in

Reading

so that's

really good

so Tuesday

night

we'll be

ready to

go

full switch

over

and then

right now

I'm arriving

on Tuesday

Tuesday morning

or when

night

Tuesday night

perfect

so I should

come to

Westfield

you should

come to

West

well

we're not

going to

Westfield

till 9pm

you might

be a bit

tired

but

you could

come meet

us in

the morning

Westfield

Wednesday

morning

because

Steph

is going

to be

in Paris

until late

Tuesday

night

so Steph

is going

to

I'm going

to set

everything

up in

White City

Tuesday

night

and then

Steph

is meeting

us

on site

before

trade

Wednesday

morning

in White

City

so come

meet us

then

right

so you'll

see everything

in full

effect

which is

better

yeah

okay

we'll figure

that out

good

Wednesday

yeah

Wednesday

day

there's a

photo shoot

happening

for online

so that's

being shot

Wednesday

day

and then

we'll have

we

everything

will be

logistically

done

ready to

go on

the website

it will

take

about a

week

before

everything's

retouched

and turned

around and

put on

the site

so the

week after

next we

can start

testing

online

and then

I know we

were thinking

about only

doing two

wall bays

in Reading

but I

to test

but I

think we

should just

do the

full store

because it's

a small

store

and get a

proper read

of it

because otherwise

we'll put the

two wall bays

in and we'll

go now

imagine what

that would

do if

sale product

wasn't there

why don't

we just

do it

now

because sale

is fatigued

like hugely

fatigued

anyway

let me

just

the pros

and cons

are

we're

concentrating

on getting

white city

right

it's a

trial

right

and we

haven't got

the full

fit out

done yet

you're going

to now

convert it

it's what

I've been

referring to

as a

hybrid

you know

it's

now

rather than

having

reading the

whole store

to me

it's

we've got

to get

white city

right

and we've

got to get

it right

from an

operation

point of

view

as well

as a

product

point of

view

and we've

got to

get it

right

from

a

merch

how do

we

merchandise

this

store

and to

have

two

just

puts

more

complexity

into

it

even

though

I love

your

desire

and your

let's

get it

all

done

but I'm

not

I'm just

not 100%

certain

we don't

want to

get

distracted

and

you've

got to

work in

these

stores

yeah

I'm not

sure we

need to

do that

because it's

we need

to do it

really quickly

but when we

do reading

it'll be

the whole

refit

right

that

and

rather

than

a

butchered

version

okay

but we

can do

it

so I'm

not

I'm

just

not

you just

thrown

that at

me

right

well I'm

just

thinking

then we

get a

good read

on a

grade

center

b

grade

center

yeah

so

so

because

yeah

it's a

full

read

then

yeah

okay

what do

we

when you

shift it

and shift

all the

junk out

what are

we going

to take

take

what is

our turnover

going to be

in a full

week

of

oh and

sales

it needs

to be up

near the

20k

what are

you expecting

you know the

product you're

bringing in

you now know

the market

you now know

let's shift

all this

you're not

confused about

this cheap

stuff that

was 500
