get a

good read

on a

grade

center

b

grade

center

yeah

so

so

because

yeah

it's a

full

read

then

yeah

okay

what do

we

when you

shift it

and shift

all the

junk out

what are

we going

to take

take

what is

our turnover

going to be

in a full

week

of

oh and

sales

it needs

to be up

near the

20k

what are

you expecting

you know the

product you're

bringing in

you now know

the market

you now know

let's shift

all this

you're not

confused about

this cheap

stuff that

was 500

now 50

what are we

going to

take

between 15

and 20k

now 15k

is not

enough right

so how much

are we going

to blame

the fact that

it's not a

full fit

out and

it's doing

it on the

cheap

no we're

not

because

a fit

out only

equates to

20%

uplift

anyway

okay so

20%

well

that's

that if

it's 15

that's

another

three

for me

the magic

number is

20k

what's our

rant there

remind me

320

all in

I think

it is

320

let me

check

Por

Ms

90%

terior

40

not

30

pounds

those

little

bastards

3.20 pounds, those little bastards.

I'm just confirming that one minute.

It's been a while since I've looked at that.

Okay, here we go.

Ruthie, it says I need a password here.

Pass me my phone, would you?

It's over there.

What the hell's going on here?

What do I need a password for?

I think lovisa always need it.

No, well, how do I get it?

190K.

190, doesn't matter, I've got it now.

The answer, thanks.

But let's check that tomorrow.

Okay, 190.

Okay.

Yeah, 190.

So we have to do, to even be close, that's gross?

That's a gross number, right?

Not the?

258 is the gross.

Don't you ever tell me?

Yeah, it's because I just read the first number, sorry.

Don't read the first number.

258.

So we need to take, absolutely to be close to the mark, bloody hell, we need to take 1.2 million per year.

So we need at least 20 grand, at least, probably more likely.

25.

Oh, no, because we've got Christmas and stuff in there.

So we probably need to take 21, 22 to be really excited.

Okay.

In a normal week.

And we're in normal weeks now, right?

Yeah.

So 15 won't do it.

Nope.

22K is the number.

Yeah.

Excellent.

Okay.

Then the next thing is the operational excellence.

The reason I wouldn't want you to go to Reading, we need to figure out other stuff, like, did you get that one?

Mm-hmm.

Sorry.

What?

What?

I swiped down.

Swiped down.

Swiped down.

Yeah.

Okay.

Hit the number.

Yes.

Yeah.

Sorry.

Sorry, Leah.

That's fine.

Approved.

We're just, LaVisa won't let me in.

We just had to.

But anyway, you've given me the number.

So there you go.

That's the 21.

So make sure that you get that firmly in your head.

22K is the number.

22K is the number.

Yeah.

You know, 20, somewhere post 20.

And that's where I'm still a little nervous.

Are we wide enough?

Do we have some of the, because do we have enough skews?

We're doing it through wholesale add-ons that we don't have, which can represent, you know, 5%, 10% of your sales, which is in this case 1,000 pound to 2,000 per week.

So there's a fair bit of other stuff just to make sure we get right.

And the team, we have to be brutal on the team because we won't need as many.

And so what are we doing with the team on the day that we go for Monty?

On Wednesday.

They're going to have T-shirts on.

They're going to be briefed.

How many do you need?

Good question.

I'll figure it out.

Because what you have to do is shift those people because we are so over, we've got too many people, right?

What's our percentage?

What has been our percentage on wages?

Ridiculous.

It's like 198%.

Across the business.

At the moment, per store, it's like, what, 38% the last two weeks ago.

So it's got to be half that, right?

It's got to be, yeah.

So that's why you've got to go, because there's more to do here, Lee, than just product.

Yeah, I know.

And you've got to start that way, right?

Because you and Zoe haven't been concentrating on costs, but your, so LaVisa runs at about 15%.

As a matter of fact, I'll tell you in the UK exactly what it is.

Give me a second.

Okay.

Now, we don't have to perform at the level of LaVisa, but these are guides.

So occupancy costs in the UK is 15.5%.

Yep.

And the wages in the UK is 13.1%.

Right.

Okay.

Very good.

Now, you know how to figure that out?

Mm-hmm.

You divide the total wages bill into the, now that's 13.1%.

Now, you at least need to get it at 20.

Yep.

Because you're going to have turnovers that will be enough to roster.

And one of the things that you and Zoe haven't been doing is we, our teams are unproductive.

Yes, they are.

And they're not sellers.

And they're not sellers.

So you now have to identify the team that you want in our new, because we're two gears down now, right?

We don't require specialised selling.

You have to think about whether we're going to do the things that we started with, some of those, if we, you know, the QR codes that give us some information that takes you directly to the web.

You know, we still need to think about these innovations that can probably happen.

And, but you need the store manager.

So you're starting with a fresh sheet of paper.

Is this the store manager we want for this store?

Is this the...

No, that's just the first act.
