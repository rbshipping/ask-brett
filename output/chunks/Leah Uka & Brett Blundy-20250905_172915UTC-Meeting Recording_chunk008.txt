It's called holiday theft.

Now, people do it without knowing it, but people do it deliberately.

Right.

It's a huge deal in retail, and you have to follow...

There's no holiday until the form is processed, and that form has to go through to payroll, and it has to be acknowledged, and you have to check up on it from time to time, right?

Yep.

So who signed off Chloe's holidays?

Chloe?

Who's Chloe?

I have no idea.

Zoe?

Zoe?

Peter did.

That was booked ages and ages ago.

And have you seen that form?

So you've got to check up on people.

I will.

So when you see a store manager on holidays, you go, show me...

You go to payroll and go, show me the holiday form for XYZ team member.

Yeah.

Your job is to trust but verify.

Yeah.

Zoe's job is to trust but verify that the process is working.

Yeah.

Because it's hugely expensive, holidays.

Yeah.

Then you've got the reason that I'm hard on you on this is you have to lead.

Culturally, you have to set the example.

And there ain't any work from home.

No.

And there ain't any, oh, I'm going off to Monaco and I'm still working.

No.

You're catching a plane to come to Monaco.

You're not working.

Okay.

And just because you put in a call when you land, you're not working.

And it's important when people take days off, take days off so you don't get burnt out, right?

If you take a day off, take a day off.

Enjoy yourself.

Rest.

Recharge.

It's really important.

And if you're going to do that, do it.

Don't.

Now, at a certain level, when we really get going, a true CEO is always being bugged on holidays with stuff.

I get that.

That comes with the territory.

But they're not working.

They're just being bugged.

You don't have to be bugged.

You've got seven stores at the moment, and I know a lot's happening.

But when you want to take a long weekend, tell me.

Take it.

You're working very hard.

And that's when you hand over things.

Don't bug me on shit that somebody else, Steph, you handle this.

Zoe, you handle this.

And if you can't handle it, of course, call me.

And it's really important that we get this going.

And you have to set the pace, or everybody else will be pretending they're working.

Yeah, I know.

And productivity drops down.

People deserve breaks, and they deserve holidays.

They get them.

They should take them.

But they have to be taken at a time that is of the choosing of the business.

And they have to be signed off on.

They have to be approved.

And the approval has to go through to payroll.

Yeah.

And there is about 10 touch points that can go wrong in that process.

And it's another sort of shrinking.

All right.

You're the best.

John and I were talking about you today.

Oh, Christ.

Okay.

Good or bad?

I can't tell you, because it's a people asset review, which we'll have to start doing soon.

So I can't tell you, because it was about you, not for you to know about.

But what I can tell you, it was great.

Oh, good.

Okay.

I'll sleep well then.

You can sleep very well.

You've got a big supporter in John.

You have a big supporter in me, and you're doing a great job.

Thank you.

Well, I'm loving it.

I think this is great.

I, like, look forward to every day.

Well, we're loving having you.

So get to it.

All right.

That's enough.

Wait.

Just one last thing then.

So I sent a holiday form to Peter ages ago for October.

Should I just resend it to you?

What, was it signed off?

Yeah, he signed it off.

All done.

So you have to check it's gone to payroll.

But, yes, you should send that to me.

Yeah.

Because even I do this.

When CEOs are on holiday, I send a note off to payroll.

Please tell me that there's the form.

Yeah.

It's been signed.

It's a huge issue.

Now, it's a huge issue even with seven stores.

Yeah.

But I can tell you it's a monster of an issue with 1,000 stores.

I imagine.

And everybody sooner or later screws this up and then there's a matter of, oh, is somebody

being dishonest or is it an honest mistake?

But nonetheless, it's thousands and thousands and thousands of pounds all the time.

Yeah.

I'll be all over it.

Don't worry.

Okay.

And when in October?

It's for five days.

It's the, what is it?

The sixth.

Sorry, the, yeah, sixth to the tenth.

Beautiful.

But I'll be available.

I'm just, I'm in Dubai.

In Dubai.

It's fucking hot in Dubai.

I know, but Jax really wants to swim with the bloody dolphins and I booked it ages ago.

So.

You'll fucking die.

You will be like, you'll be like a beetroot.

I know.

I know.

But they need, they need, they need some time with me.

Of course they do.

No, I'm with you.

You put it in.

You need, I'm all for, you need a rest.

You're working your tits off.

I, I, I don't like it personally.

I, but it is what it is.

But I booked it, I booked it literally ages ago, like December last year.

Stop talking.

You're wasting my time.

Okay.

Bye.

I'm going to get the bad news from Ness.

I'll speak to you in a bit.

Bye.

Bye.
