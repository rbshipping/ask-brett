And that, there's coaching and training required.

But what you're saying is all this can be done.

You got, Zoe, get to a store, Monday, train, train, train, coach, mentor, teach, fire.

Now, one of the things is just mark this down.

How many people have been exited from the business?

Because it's impossible to hire however many people we hired, however many months ago that

was, and for them all to succeed, be motivated and driven and have the right attitude.

It's impossible.

Yeah.

And we should not have any weak links.

No.

So, I have a spreadsheet of everyone that's come in and out and people that are on the

way out at the moment from Zoe in the business.

So, it's an ongoing thing.

But, yeah, it's a constant.

It's just there's a lot that we need to get out and a lot that we need to get in.

So, my view was, yeah, we do need Ubik, obviously.

But right now, she needs to focus on getting the right people in and leading by example

and getting the stores and the store standards up to where it needs to be.

Otherwise, she'll just focus on online trading.

Everyone else will carry on as is.

And then it would just be an absolute nightmare.

Right.

Okay.

So, we know what the problem is.

That means we're halfway to the solution.

Zoe has got to...

We've got to put in...

Now, we have an area manager.

So, typically, an area manager would look after eight stores, right?

So, we have an area manager, regional.

And then we've got Zoe.

Typically, Zoe's position would look after...

Multiple, yeah.

Just numbers that would go from 30 to 70 stores and multiple regional managers underneath.

And Zoe's done all that.

And yet, we can't seem to get...

And so, there's an element of both you and Zoe not going,

every team member needs to know this.

By next week, I want them to know this.

And Zoe should be able to do that on her own.

But she isn't.

And you've got to learn it.

So, what is it?

And we should be just continuously recruiting for new people.

So, we just go, okay, you don't want to do it next.

And then, who's training them?

So, anyway, you're on to it.

So, let me not gabble on.

That's great.

We don't want to lose Zoe.

We just can't.

No, definitely not.

But start-ups require lots of energy.

Yeah.

All right.

Now, what's happening?

Tuesday night still on?

Yep.

Tuesday night's still on.

So, we're going in.

Everybody got what they've got?

Does a train strike upset any of this learnings?

No.

No, because I'm bringing my car.

So, I'll be driving everything.

So, we haven't got to worry about transport.

Yeah.

No, everyone's just crazy carding right now.

Carding everything.

We're running low on cards.

We're expecting another delivery tomorrow.

But, yeah, we should at least have at least enough to go into White City.

So, we're good.

For sure.

Yeah.

So, make sure you get this right.

Yeah.

Okay.

Yeah.

Love that.

Is Russell helping you?

Yes.

He's good.

He cancelled last week, but he said that his laptop had broken and whatever.

So, it's fine.

But we have a call tomorrow.

And I've booked one in every Tuesday, every week.

So, we met the week before last.

And that's where I started drilling down on these costs, because I saw the same as you,

but for July.

I've only just seen August now, but for July.

So, prime example, marketing.

I mean, we've already cut that in half now.

IT spend, changing the software subscriptions, because that's the biggest bulk of the spend.

Admin, consumables costs, and things like that.

So, it's all stuff that we can be bringing right down.

So, I've already started on that.

So, I can, we can talk through that when we have our meeting.

Okay.

Got that.

That's great.

What else did I have for you?

I had something.

Oh, here it is.

It's been printed out for me.

Wednesday.

Have you got this?

Is this going to you?

Yes.

You've got this.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

She's not supposed to tell you what call I'm on, but she did.

2.30, depending on the traffic.

Yeah.

You need to be at Heathrow for half, for when?

Half three?

You need to leave earlier.

4.30, usually.

4.45, latest.

Yeah.

You need to be leaving about two, half two.

So, half two is fine.

You should be fine.

We can slot finance in before or after product.

Does it not matter?

So, don't start me anything before about, because there's course,

they can finish early or finish late.

Just let me check something here that Javier has just sent me.

No, no, that's not related to this.

Shall I slot you at 10?

Yeah, 10 would be safer, so we don't piss anybody off.

Products.

How much value am I going to get out of?

Yeah, we've got a product.

Let's have product, and then let's have Russell.

Yeah.

Brilliant.

Remember, product always takes longer.

Yeah.

I'm having dinner with Tia on...

Wednesday night.

Wednesday night.

Okay.

Okay, so I'm...

Well, how the hell am I going to get out to Westfield if there's no trains?

I'll pick you up in the morning.

You'll be bleary-eyed and dead.

No, I won't.

I'll pick you up from your hotel Wednesday morning.

Right.

There was one other thing that I had for you.

What else have you got for me?

That's it for now.

Hey, Ruth, are you still here?

Well, I had something else for...

Didn't I tell you that?

Hold on, Leah.

Sorry, I'm so organised.

It's okay.

Sometimes remarkable.

You must think, how the hell did he ever do so well?

No.

I'll let you off.

You've got about 20 million brands and 20 million people calling you,

so don't worry.

What the hell?
