No, I won't.

I'll pick you up from your hotel Wednesday morning.

Right.

There was one other thing that I had for you.

What else have you got for me?

That's it for now.

Hey, Ruth, are you still here?

Well, I had something else for...

Didn't I tell you that?

Hold on, Leah.

Sorry, I'm so organised.

It's okay.

Sometimes remarkable.

You must think, how the hell did he ever do so well?

No.

I'll let you off.

You've got about 20 million brands and 20 million people calling you,

so don't worry.

What the hell?

Ah.

Yes.

Thanks.

The topic that we don't want to discuss.

This whole leave approval process has done my head in.

The October one hasn't come through.

Has that already been approved previously?

I sent that to Peter months ago, so maybe, I don't know,

if it's on there.

That's what it will be.

Now, through this process, what did you think?

Not about your person, but you've now got to think about how does this work

because everybody, area managers, Zoe, other department heads,

are all using this process.

Yeah.

How does it work?

So you go onto the fresh ticket system.

Yeah.

And you upload when you want to have off,

and then it comes through to an approval manager.

And what is fresh?

Fresh is Lovisa's ticketing system.

It's, like, used for every single thing that they do across the business.

And so you go into payroll?

Yeah.

You go into leave requests on there,

and then it logs it through to payroll, HR, everything.

How does Zoe know how much leave each one of her team members currently has?

So we can pull a report off of fresh.

Ah.

So you can go in and ask.

You can.

But also, if a team member has used up their leave,

it won't let them resubmit.

It won't let them submit a leave request.

Okay.

So if you don't have any leave, it'll just go, it will tell you.

Okay.

And so you think it works well?

Yeah, it does.

Very smooth and slick.

Yeah.

Good for you.

You're looking good today, by the way.

Thank you.

Thanks.

I'm allowed to say that, Ruth.

I'm allowed to say that because...

I said it to her.

I'm not your last chance.

You said it to her.

Yeah.

She looks really nice with her.

Oh, yeah.

Yours.

Joy.

Okay.

Well, that's all I've got.

There must be more.

How are the sales?

What happened on the weekend with our...

Good.

It's just consistently good.

So we have sold out of another line.

It was peaking at around 31% total sales.

But sale is fatiguing, hugely.

So we're doing a...

I need to get waterproof up and running this week in White City.

And then on Tuesday next week, we're doing a full VM refresh across every store.

Have you got all the...

All the...

Wall-based, what do we call them?

What are we calling them?

All the panels arrived today.

It took much in three hours to get it.

Because of the tube strike.

That's it.

It's a 45-minute drive, three hours to get there.

But we've picked them up.

They're in the van.

And he's currently in his shed, in his garden, putting all the magnets and everything on them.

So...

He loves it.

I'm going to call him.

He's so good.

I'm going to call him right now.

Oh, no.

That's Google.

Can't do that.

What's that?

Oh, Sam sent me a message.

Oh, I love it when he sends me a message.

Jesus, I need some...

On my face.

What's going on?

You better get me some stuff to put on my face.

What's wrong with your face?

I don't know.

It's all gone dry or something.

Moisturiser.

He's a good moisturizer.

He's not answering.

Oh.

He will.

There he is.

Hi, sir.

Martin, how are you?

I'm on the...

I'm on the phone with Leah.

Can you see her there?

Wave, Leah.

Hi.

I'm in a workshop.

Look, I love it.

She told me you were three hours asleep at the wheel this morning trying to get panels,

and now you're in your garden shed sorting them out.

You're unbelievable.

Thank you.

And are we going to be ready for tomorrow?

Yes.

Is that a real year?

As long as we've got the product, we're going to be younger from Purelli.

Yeah.

Okay.

Well, have we got the product?

Are you worried that we won't have the product?

No, we've got bits we brought with us, and then there's some other bits gradually arriving,

so I'm not sure how many of that came yet.

Most of it's arrived.

Most of it's arrived, Leah's telling me.

We have at least...

Oh, perfect.

Sorry.

Yeah.

You're looking younger.

What's going on?

You've been putting collagen on your face.

What's going on?

You're looking...

Kids are back at school.

Oh, that'll do it.

Yeah.

All right, Matt.

I'm looking forward to seeing you, and thanks for getting this done.

I'm getting a bit excited that we're on the right track.

So...

There's one of them.

Oh, hello.

Someone say hello.

What's her name?

What's your name, babe?

Adele.

Adele, how are you?

I'm Brett.

Is your dad doing a good job with our panels?

Have you had a look?

No.

You.

Oh, she didn't have a look.

She didn't have a look.

Well, I'm sure he is.

Nice to meet you, Adele.

She's up to nutsticks in a second.

Perfect.

All right.

Buddy, thanks, mate.

I just wanted to check in and say thanks.

No.

I was...

Not tomorrow.

Wednesday.

Yeah.

Wednesday, yes.

Okay.

Yeah, not altered.

See you soon.

Ciao.

Bye.

Bye-bye.

He's a good egg.

He's a good egg.

He's there.

And we need...

I need to ask him.

I should have...

Just ask him to take a selfie of himself working.

These are...

I've got loads of...
