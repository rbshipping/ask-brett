So, first of all, so, we're going to do it.

and he just said, you know, bring all this down.

So everything's a learning, Leah, everything.

Yeah, yeah.

You're still up for it?

How's your therapist?

How's Stephen your therapist?

Yeah, he's good.

He's fine.

I don't, he just, yeah, he's a really good guy.

He's a good guy.

I don't know what he's trying to get out of me.

It's, like, weird.

He's, like, trying to be a therapist.

But, no, he's good.

Did he drive you crazy or was it good?

No, no, he doesn't.

He's fine.

He's great.

But I don't know.

He's, like, I don't know if he, he's, like, oh, like, are you stressed?

Like, how are you feeling?

And I feel like an asshole because I'm, like, no, I'm fine.

But I feel like he's expecting me to say, no, like, this is stressful.

And then he can help me.

But I'm, he's just, he's, like, are you stressed?

I'm, like, no, absolutely not.

Like, this is fine.

Like, I love it.

So I don't know.

Yeah, he probably just thinks, what the hell is this woman on about?

But I think he's great.

I think he's useful.

You want more of him?

Yeah, I like him.

I think he's useful.

He helps you think about things.

One of the things that he was really helpful with, the biggest thing I took away, which I was, it was already actually weirdly on my mind, which is why I brought it up with him.

Is now that, like, White City, you know, White City, okay, forget about the last couple of days, but we will get it right.

And the same with Reading.

Now that we start bringing in those figures is I don't want the team to suddenly start thinking, right, okay, I can breathe a bit now.

You know, we're getting there.

So I don't want complacency to sat in.

So he was, like, help me kind of identify, well, yeah, you don't want complacency, so here's the things that you should think about to stop that from happening.

So that was really, really useful.

Good.

I'm glad of that.

Do you want to know what he said about you?

Oh, God.

Go on, then.

She's a nutcase.

I didn't need Stephen to tell me that.

He says to me, Bebe, it must be a joy to work with Leah.

I went, what?

That's his opening line.

It must be a joy.

So he likes you, obviously.

Oh.

She is unemotional in execution, intensely loyal and boundless energy.

She feels on top of everything, knows what to do, not alone at the top, perhaps giving you blah, blah, blah.

No longer one, blah, blah.

She's worried about no longer one of them.

She was one of the peers.

Now she's not because she's got to learn to have empathy as a boss.

Yes.

Yeah.

You do.

And it's tricks like this.

And one of the things, you know, you asked me about, how do I stay so calm?

Because you read that note from this girl and everyone gets defensive, right?

You teach yourself to go, okay, she's angry at us.

We've probably screwed up somewhere.

She's a dick.

We don't need her.

But we've probably screwed up somewhere.

I wonder where we've screwed up.

Yeah.

And then it turns around to, oh, where's our issue in this, right?

And then, of course, it's annoying because you've got to deal with this stuff.

So he wrote very nice things about you.

Right.

And you keep reminding everybody how ambitious you are, which I like.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

Remember to keep that in check, right?

Yeah.

You can say it to me and him, but just keep that in check.

I wouldn't ever say it to anybody else, no.

And he was talking to me about that as well.

Good.

John is, as John's spoken to you, his concern is when are we going to start to place orders with the non-wholesale?

This week.
