So he wrote very nice things about you.

Right.

And you keep reminding everybody how ambitious you are, which I like.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

Remember to keep that in check, right?

Yeah.

You can say it to me and him, but just keep that in check.

I wouldn't ever say it to anybody else, no.

And he was talking to me about that as well.

Good.

John is, as John's spoken to you, his concern is when are we going to start to place orders with the non-wholesale?

This week.

So those orders are coming to you this week.

So then we can sign that off and get it going.

We're in the right time frame of our critical path.

Everything is to time.

All right.

And what is Zoe doing currently?

She's still doing her role as head of retail right now.

Right.

She'll be doing that until I find a replacement.

Okay.

Good.

All right, champ.

Anything else?

Nope.

Stephen, by the way, is in America with me in the next few days.

Okay.

He'll be annoying me.

My therapist.

You think he's my therapist?

God.

He ain't my therapist.

He makes out he is.

Yeah, that's part of his problem.

Part of his ego.

What are you doing in America, if you don't mind me asking?

You're not allowed to ask what I'm doing in America.

Why not?

You can ask.

What are you doing in America?

I haven't got time to tell you.

You've got 13 minutes.

I'm getting my 13 minutes back.

Thank you.

All right.

Okay.

Good work.

Get at it.

Keep your pace there.

If you don't deliver me $17,000, don't bother talking to me this week.

Okay.

Bye.

Bye.

Bye.

Bye.
