Customer complaint reports

Eliminate the reasons why we say no to a customer and how we empower our teams to do whatever it takes to please the customer.

31

[Slide 33]

Customer Concerns

CEOs take the initial call/review the e-mail when we receive customer concern?

A customer does us a huge favour by making a complaint and as long as we don’t get defensive, we fix the issue immediately.

We take the customers, side and then we address the issue, the issue can be an individual team member, a process, or procedure

People, process and approach

Discussion

Demotions or putting team back

Termination Policy- max 4 weeks

Dear All,

It’s come to my attention that a number recent terminations have been given payouts far exceeding anything we are required to give as part of our contracts. So much so that it has raised concern.

Terminations are never easy. Throwing money at the situation does not make it better or easier. It just creates a precedent and expectation that makes it harder as we move forward.

We must always do the right thing by our team members. This means having the tough performance conversation early on and giving them an opportunity to turn things around. Only in the rarest of occasions should a termination come as a complete surprise. Having the tough performance discussion also requires clear development tasks / goals, with clear deadlines and close monitoring. We must give them the right opportunity to prove themselves but at the same time not allow for a situation that is not working to drag on –it’s not healthy for the team member going through it or the fellow team members they’re working with.

Please, going forward any termination where a payout exceeds what is in the contract (4 weeks) requires prior approval from myself. No exceptions.

Further no employment agreement can be entered into that exceeds 4 weeks termination notice, without my approval. No exceptions

Thanks,

Brett Blundy

Let's make it happen!

Success never happens because we hope or wish it will.  It happens because we decide what should happen, what needs to change, what our culture needs to be and what people need to be and then we need to get out and communicate, communicate, communicate any way that you can and as frequently as you can in words and in actions.

Don Soderquist

Communicate! Communicate! Communicate!
