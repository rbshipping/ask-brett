LESSONS OF LIFE

1. If you lose your health, nothing else matters regardless of your success. How

much money would Kerry Packer have paid to be able to get a new kidney?

Meditation / Trainer/ Drugs / Alcoholism.

2. If you lose your integrity, no amount of success will be meaningful and it will

produce a hollow feeling when you look in the mirror. | wonder what would fellow

YPOers Allan Bond, Brian Quinn, Laurie Connell and Rodney Adler say on this

subject? What would they say today as to what is important to them?

3. Control your own destiny — most satisfied people | know have control over their

own lives / affairs. Independence to do what you want to do when / where you

want to do it is probably what we are all seeking. How many unhappy people are

in jobs / activities / relationships because of economic necessity? Payment,

school fees etc in a job they hate. Have a vision / dream where you want to go.

4. Be prepared to take some risks / life is an adventure / challenge. When you are

young, you can afford to fail because you can start over again. When you're old,

you need the stimulation.

Caveats to risk:

a. Don't bet the farm. Things go wrong with the bestlaid plans. Spread the

risk. Debt 1975 — 27% / 90 day bank bills. In cricket terms, you don’t

have to swing for a 6 on all occasions. Singles and doubles will get you

there. Power of compound interest.

b. There is no shortage of good deals / ideas. Don’t fall in love with a

business or put yourself in peril chasing something and forget the

fundamentals.

c. Number one priority of a CEO is to make sure the company stays in

business / survives. What threats can take you out of the game? What

decisions if wrong could be terminal? Margin of error?

d. Think through the worst-case scenario action plan. Accept that without

risk, and the possibility of failure, maybe success will be limited.

e. Don't wait until the dogs are barking at the door to do things. Banks don't

give out umbrella’s when it’s raining. When they pass around the bickies

($) take some as they probably won't be passing them when you want / or

need them.

5. Get some § out of the business that is risk / market adverse / counter balance the

existing investment / businesses / sleep better at night.

. Keep some powder dry

e An opportunity fund / capacityto raise $ when the right deal presents itself.

e Be prepared to model / test / prove people will pay real $ for the product prior

to boots and all commitment / step-by-step rather than putting it all on the

nose to win.

. Family:

Find a tolerant wife/partner who can appreciate your search for success /

fulfillment. AWOL when my kids were born %. Be good to your kids as they will

be the ones checking you into the nursing home.

Edmonton story. It can be very unfulfilling trying to enjoy yourself when nobow

else likes your company.

. Never, never give up if you think you are right. Big companies operate on the

basis that the little guy will fold. Showing up eliminates 85% of the competitors

who won't go the distance. The flip side of this is don’t die on your sword in

pursuit of mission impossible. Be prepared to cut your losses. Kenny Rogers —

you got to know when to hold them and when to fold them.

. Don't get caught up in your own self-importance. Try to be humble even if you

don’t believe it. Be able to laugh at yourself.

10. Life / business is about dealing with people. You can solve the biggest problems

if you can maintain a smile and a sense of humour. Try and surround yourself

with smart people who complement your skills. Pay attention to the big stuff /

delegate the mundane.

11.Focus: Get a mainstream business that produces cash flow. Be a rifle nota

shotgun. Tax Man helps share in losses instead of capital. Beware new girl /

prettier theory / diversions.

12.Understand the business — 2 great bubble / acquisition in the mid 80’s — Bond

Corp etc — paper deals — greater fool theory— internet — ecommerce / defied

logic / fundamentals
