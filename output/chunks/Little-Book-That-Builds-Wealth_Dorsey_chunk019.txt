SUMMARY: The text discusses how the network effect can benefit some financial exchanges, such as futures exchanges, but not others, like stock exchanges, due to differences in market structure and competition.

can be deep, meaning that participants can trade a large

volume of assets without affecting the quoted price.

Sounds like a great business, right? Let the network

effect work its magic to build a nice pool of liquidity that’s

both deep and broad, and watch the profits roll in. That’s

actually not a bad description of futures exchanges like the

Chicago Mercantile Exchange (the Merc) and the New York

Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), which are enormously

profitable companies with wide moats due to their net-

work-induced liquidity. Unfortunately, the story is a bit

more complicated, because exchanges that trade mainly

stocks—like the NYSE and NASDAQ—have much weaker

competitive advantages, even though they also have deep

pools of liquidity.

In fact, stock exchanges have seen falling returns on

capital in recent years as competition has moved in, while

futures exchanges have maintained very robust profitabil-

ity. This is because futures contracts are captive to an

individual exchange—if I buy a futures contract on the

NYMEX or the Merc, I have to sell it there. (The reason

for this is complicated, so just trust me.) Futures exchanges

can extract a lot more value from market participants,

because they exert more control over each transaction.

Stocks, however, can be bought and sold on a wide

variety of exchanges, which leads to much greater price

competition. A professional investor might buy a thou-

sand shares of IBM on the NYSE, but wind up selling

them on any one of a half dozen other exchanges that also

trade Big Blue’s shares, if one of those other exchanges

offers a better price. Because the pool of liquidity in IBM

shares is not limited to any one exchange, none of them

benefits from the network effect nearly as much as futures

exchanges do.

The lesson here is that for a company to benefit from

the network effect, it needs to operate a closed network,

and when formerly closed networks open up, the net-

work effect can dissipate in a hurry. It’s a good question

to ask whenever you’re evaluating a company that might

benefit from network economics: How might that net-

work open up to other participants?

THE NETWORK EFFECT [69]

Moving on from exchanges to other industries, we

also see the network effect at work in lots of other areas

of the market. Money-transfer firm Western Union is

just one good example, and the value of its network to

users is demonstrated by the fact that even though its net-

work is three times larger than that of its closest competi-

tor, Western Union processes about five times as many

transactions. In other words, Western Union gets more

business per location—on average—because its users can

send money to more places than they could if they used

the competition.

This is a common effect of network-based businesses:

The benefit of having a larger network is nonlinear, which

means that the economic value of the network increases

at a faster rate than its absolute size. You can get some

sense of this by looking at Exhibit 5 .2 and Exhibit 5 .3 ,

which compare the number of nodes in a network—analo-

gous to the number of Western Union locations—with

the number of connections between those nodes.

It’s pretty incredible to see how fast the number of

connections grows as you add more nodes. Practically

speaking, you easily can see how attractive the economics

are. If a network-based business increases its invested

capital by, say, 50 percent to expand its number of nodes

from 20 to 30, it increases the number of connections by

almost 130 percent, from 190 to 435.

Of course, you need to be a bit careful with this kind

of analysis, because the odds are very good that not all

connections in a network are equally valuable to all users.

Sticking with Western Union as an example, I would

THE NETWORK EFFECT [71]

imagine that the large number of Western Union branches

in various parts of Mexico makes the service very valuable

for folks who live in the Pilsen neighborhood in C hicago,

where I live, because Pilsen is home to a large number of

immigrants with ties to Mexico. But I don’t think there

are all that many Pilsen residents who are sending money

to Dubai or Dhaka, so those particular node-to-node con-

nections aren’t as valuable to most folks in Pilsen.

It’s fair to say that the value of a network to its users

is more closely tied to the number of connections than

it is to the number of nodes, but the value-to-connection

relationship likely slows down as the number of connec-

tions becomes extremely large.

Our next set of network-effect examples comes from an

incredibly profitable industry that’s not nearly as well known

as it should be: third-party logistics. That may sound dull,

but 40 percent returns on capital combined with 20 to 30

percent growth rates over more than a decade should pique

your interest. How did firms like Expeditors International

and C. H. Robinson compile such impressive track records?

By building moats based on the network effect.

Both of these companies essentially connect shippers

with cargo carriers—think of them as brokers for cargo

space. C. H. Robinson operates in the U.S. trucking

industry, matching companies with cargo to ship with

trucking operators that want to keep their trailers as full
