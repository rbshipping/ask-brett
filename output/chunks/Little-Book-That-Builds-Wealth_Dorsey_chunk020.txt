percent growth rates over more than a decade should pique

your interest. How did firms like Expeditors International

and C. H. Robinson compile such impressive track records?

By building moats based on the network effect.

Both of these companies essentially connect shippers

with cargo carriers—think of them as brokers for cargo

space. C. H. Robinson operates in the U.S. trucking

industry, matching companies with cargo to ship with

trucking operators that want to keep their trailers as full

as possible. The more shippers with which C. H. Robinson

has relationships, the more attractive the company becomes

to cargo-hungry truckers, and vice versa. This is a text-

book example of the network effect, and it’s also a very

strong competitive advantage.

Expeditors International is a little bit different. The

company operates internationally, and is more than just a

matchmaker; essentially, the company’s clients ask it to

move goods across borders within a defined time frame,

and Expeditors takes care of the details. Expeditors buys

cargo space on planes and ships on behalf of its clients, fills

that space with clients’ cargo, and also takes care of what-

ever other complications—customs, tariffs, warehousing—

might arise between the point of origin and the point of

departure.

Expeditors International’s moat lies in its extensive

branch network, which enables it to serve customers more

effectively, because no matter where they need to ship

stuff, odds are good that Expeditors has a branch at both

the sending end and the receiving end. One way to verify

this is to do a bit of financial sleuthing. If a larger net-

work really does mean that Expeditors can push more

cargo through each branch, then the company’s operat-

ing income per branch should increase, as new branches

add cargo flow to existing ones. It turns out that this is

exactly what has happened. (See Exhibit 5 .4 .)

Wrapping up, let’s come full circle and look at a com-

pany that is a lot like that social butterfly I profiled at the

very beginning of the chapter. The Corporate Executive

Board publishes best-practices research for large corpo-

rations, essentially helping executives figure out how to

solve some of the problems they encounter by sharing the

experiences of other companies that have faced similar

issues. You can see the network effect already—the more

companies that are in the Corporate Executive Board’s

network, the more likely it is to have relevant information

for its members. It also helps members by connecting

them together for one-off problems.

The beauty of this business is that the published research

is actually less valuable than the network at the end of the day.

After all, if you’re a time-challenged high-level executive at a

large company, which network are you going to join? The one

to which all the other time-challenged senior managers from

large companies already belong, of course, because they’re

the people you’re competing with, and you probably want to

stay abreast of what they’re thinking. Any potential competi-

tor to Corporate Executive Board would need to replicate this

network to successfully compete with the firm, which seems

unlikely as long as its network keeps growing.

As you can see, the network effect is a pretty power-

ful competitive advantage. It is not insurmountable, but

it’s a tough one for a competitor to crack in most circum-

stances. This is one moat that is not easy to find, but it’s

worth a lot of investigation when you do find it.

The Bottom Line

1. A company benefits from the network effect when

the value of its product or service increases with the

number of users. Credit cards, online auctions, and

some financial exchanges are good examples.

2. The network effect is an extremely powerful type

of competitive advantage, and it is most often

found in businesses based on sharing informa-

tion or connecting users together. You don’t see it

much in businesses that deal in physical goods.

O FAR ALL OF THE SOURCES

that we’ve discussed have focused on price, or how much

value a company can extract from its customers. Intangi-

ble assets, switching costs, and the network effect all a llow

a company to charge more for a product or service than it

would be able to without those advantages. The converse

of price, of course, is cost, and companies can also dig

moats around their businesses by having sustainable lower

costs than the competition.

Cost advantages can sometimes be durable, but they

can also disappear very quickly, so as an investor you need

to be able to determine whether a company’s cost advantage

is replicable by a competitor. Lots of companies over the

past few years have puffed their chests out about how they

lowered costs by moving a call center or manufacturing

facility to some low-cost region of the world—China, India,

the Philippines, you name it. They act as if management’s

collective IQ doubled the day some middle manager sug-

gested that the company source low-end parts from a fac-

tory with 80 percent lower labor costs.

This is not genius, nor is it a sustainable competitive

advantage, because those same low-cost resources are

very likely available to any company that wants them. If

one auto-parts supplier starts sourcing low-value-added

components from China, how long will it take its competi-

tors to make the same phone calls and set up similar sup-
