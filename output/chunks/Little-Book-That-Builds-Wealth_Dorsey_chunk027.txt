Mexico; the Auckland, New Zealand, airport; Schipol

in Amsterdam; and several others. While regulatory

approval—an intangible asset—is certainly one type of

competitive advantage enjoyed by airports, single-competitor

economics also apply. Many markets have only enough

air traffic to support a single airport profitably, so even

if a competitor could get the regulatory approval to

open up a second airport near Auckland or Puerto Val-

larta, doing so wouldn’t necessarily generate attrac-

tive returns on capital. This keeps new entrants out

of the market, giving many airports very wide economic

moats.

THE SIZE ADVANTAGE [101]

The Bottom Line

1. Being a big fish in a small pond is much better

than being a bigger fish in a bigger pond. Focus

on the fish-to-pond ratio, not the absolute size of

the fish.

2. D elivering fish more cheaply than anyone else

can be pretty profitable. So can delivering other

stuff.

3. S cale economies have nothing to do with the skin

on a fish, but they can create durable competitive

advantages.

almost exclusively about the signs of

a strong competitive advantage—the structural characteris-

tics of businesses that create economic moats. Investing

would be relatively simple if all we had to do was look for

companies with moats, wait for them to trade at reasonable

prices, and then lock them away forever to compound capi-

tal in competitively advantaged bliss. Sadly, the world is not

a static place, which complicates matters considerably.

[104] THE LITTLE BOOK THAT BUILDS WEALTH

The best analysis in the world can be rendered moot by

unforeseen changes in the competitive landscape. As recently

as a decade ago, being a specialist on the New York Stock

Exchange was a license to print money. Today, it’s like hav-

ing a monopoly on buggy whips. Thirty years ago, Polaroid

was revolutionizing the way people took pictures, but the

firm died a slow death long before digital imaging put

the final nail in film photography’s coffin. Long-distance

telephony and newspapers were once reliable and highly

profitable businesses, but now they struggle to generate

cash. The list goes on and on.

All of these businesses possessed strong competitive

advantages at one point in time, but the world changed to

their detriment. Although change can be an opportunity, it

can also severely erode once-wide economic moats. This is

why it is critical to continually monitor the competitive

position of the companies in which you have invested, and

watch for signs that the moat may be eroding. If you can

get an early read on a weakening competitive advantage,

you can greatly improve your odds of preserving your gains

in a successful investment—or cutting your losses on an

unsuccessful one.

Getting Zapped

There are two sides to this threat. The first is the risk that

a company that sells technology—software, semiconductors,

networking gear, you name it—loses out in the furious race

to stay on the cutting edge. Of course, most companies that

sell tech products have a hard time building a lasting com-

petitive advantage in the first place, and it’s hard to destroy

a moat that never existed. Being technologically supplanted

by a competitor is simply a fact of life for most technology

companies, because they typically win business by having a

product that is better/faster/cheaper than their peers’ prod-

ucts. So, they constantly run the risk of seeing their compet-

itive advantage disappear in months if a better product

hits the market. As one academic who studies competitive

advantage has pithily stated, “In the long run, everything is

a toaster.”

Occasionally, a product is so much better than the

rest that its success feeds on itself, and the company

becomes the de facto standard for its industry—Research

in Motion, purveyor of the ubiquitous BlackBerry mobile

e-mail device, might be a good example. But the much

more common story for technology vendors without stan-

dard-setting power is that they fade into oblivion (remem-

ber Palm?) or stumble along for years until a larger firm

puts shareholders out of their misery via an acquisition.

Technological disruption is a more unexpected—and

severe—threat when it affects nontech companies, because

these companies can look like they have very strong com-

petitive advantages before a technological shift permanently

hurts their economics. It’s one thing to have a competitive

advantage destroyed when it barely existed in the first place;

it’s quite another when a business that once looked like a

perpetual cash machine is consigned to irrelevance.

Examples of technological disruption abound. Think

about Eastman Kodak, which for decades printed money

through its dominance of the U.S. market for photo-

graphic film, and which today struggles to find a place in

a digital world. From 2002 to 2007, Kodak earned only

about $800 million in cumulative operating income, an

85 percent decline from its cumulative operating profits

for the previous five years. Whether Kodak can eventually

succeed in digital photography is still an open question,

but the economics of short product-cycle consumer elec-

tronics look tougher than the slow-moving but highly

profitable business of selling celluloid, paper, and chemi-

cals that Kodak enjoyed in the past.

Newspapers were once some of the best businesses in

the world, reliably throwing off massive cash flows through

their lock on local news, advertising, and classifieds. No

more—the Internet has done irrevocable damage to the

business of distributing daily news. Newspapers aren’t

about to disappear, but it’s unlikely they will ever be as

profitable as they once were.

The Internet has also permanently killed long-distance

telephony, another business that was once incredibly
