panies that are enabled by technology than it is

for companies that sell technology, because the

effects can be more unexpected.

2. I f a company’s customer base becomes more con-

centrated, or if a competitor has goals other than

making money, the moat may be in danger.

3. Growth is not always good. It’s better for a com-

pany to make lots of money doing what it is good

at, and give the excess back to shareholders, than

it is to throw the excess profits at a questionable

line of business with no moat. Microsoft could

get away with it, but most companies can’t.

Finding Moats

(cid:1)

It’s a Jungle Out There.

NE OF THE BEST THINGS

about being an intelligent investor

is that the world is your oyster. You’re not forced to invest in

industry A or industry B, so you’re free to cast a discerning

eye over the entire investment universe, ignoring what you

don’t like and buying what you do. This freedom is espe-

cially important if you are looking to build a portfolio of

companies with economic moats, because it’s a lot easier to

dig a moat in some industries than in others.

Let me repeat myself, because this is a critically

important point: Some industries are brutally competitive

and have awful economics, and creating a competitive

advantage requires the managerial equivalent of a Nobel

Prize. Other industries are much less competitive, and

even average companies are able to sustain solid returns

on capital. (No one ever said life was fair.) As an inves-

tor, you’ll have better odds hunting for ideas in indus-

tries where managers only need to hurdle one-foot

bars to succeed than you will looking for long-term win-

ners in industries where the barriers to success are much

higher.

Looking at opposite ends of the spectrum, consider

auto parts and asset management. No, it’s not a fair fight,

but that’s precisely my point. Morningstar covers 13 auto-

parts companies, only two of which have economic moats.

The remainder struggle to generate decent returns on

capital, and those that do have only fleeting success.

Consider American Axle, which makes—you guessed

it—axles for General Motors and Chrysler. Five years ago,

when Americans couldn’t buy SUVs fast enough, the com-

pany cranked out respectable returns on capital in the low

to mid-teens. But since 2003, shrinking SUV sales and an

uncompetitive cost structure have caused losses and crushed

returns on capital to single-digit levels. The same story,

with minor variations, could be repeated for many auto-

parts manufacturers, which operate in a cutthroat industry

with truly awful economics.

FINDING MOATS [117]

Turning to asset management, Morningstar covers 18

publicly traded asset managers, all of which have economic

moats. (In fact, a dozen have wide moats, while the rest

have narrow moats.) * Although the barriers to e ntry are low

in asset management—anyone willing to spend $100,000 or

so on lawyers and registration fees can start a mutual

fund—the barriers to s uccess are quite high, because it gen-

erally takes a large distribution network to really rake in the

assets. However, those assets tend to stick around once

they’re in the door, which means that money managers that

have amassed a good-sized pile of assets under manage-

ment can generally generate high returns on capital without

breaking much of a sweat.

Let’s consider something akin to a worst-case scenario

for an asset manager. Imagine a firm that specializes in

one style of investing, and that style goes out of favor,

making once-stellar returns turn into terrible ones. A few

years later, it comes to light that the company has allowed

big clients to trade its funds in a way that siphons profits

from long-term fund holders, which embroils the com-

pany in a high-profile legal snafu. Star managers leave,

*At Morningstar, we divide companies with competitive advantages into

two groups. Companies with very durable competitive advantages are la-

beled “wide moat,” and companies with identifiable but less strong advan-

tages are labeled “narrow moat.” More on separating one from the other in

Chapter 11, where we’ll walk through several examples.

many investors follow suit, and assets under management

are cut almost in half.

Doomsday? Hardly—this scenario is exactly what hap-

pened to Janus in the early part of the decade, and after

dipping to 11 percent in the trough of the crisis, operating

margins recovered to about 25 percent. That’s what you

call a resilient business model—one with a moat.

FINDING MOATS [119]

In technology, you can see that software companies

tend to have an easier time creating moats than hardware

companies. This is not simply an accounting artifact—

hardware firms are generally more capital-intensive than

software firms—but has a strong basis on the way these

two broad categories of products are used. A piece of

software often needs to be integrated with other pieces

of software to work properly, and this integration leads to

customer lock-in and higher switching costs. Hardware

is more frequently based on common industry standards,
