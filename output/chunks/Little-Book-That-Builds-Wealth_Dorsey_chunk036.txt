TOPIC: Competitive Advantage and Business Strategy
SUMMARY: CEOs often struggle to create or damage a strong competitive advantage, and successful investing requires focusing on a company's structural competitive advantages over its management.

itive advantage.” The truth of the matter, though, is that

CEOs have a hard time either creating a competitive advan-

tage where it doesn’t exist or damaging a competitive

advantage that is very strong to begin with.

It is very easy as an investor to remember the

exceptions—those companies that managed to dig moats

in tough industries, often through the vision of a talented

CEO. Companies like Starbucks, Dell, Nucor, Bed,

Bath, and Beyond, and Best Buy all created substantial

amounts of shareholder wealth by thriving in extremely

brutal industries. But by anchoring on the success of com-

panies like these and assuming their experiences are the

rule rather than the exception, we confuse the possible

with the probable. That’s not good, because a big part of

successful investing is stacking the odds in your favor.

The odds of a negative surprise from a company with

a moat and mediocre management are far lower than

from a company with no moat run by a CEO who may be

the next Jack Welch. Assuming you’ve been careful in

your competitive analysis, the firm with a moat stands a

very strong chance of retaining its competitive advan-

tage—management may surprise on the upside, or it may

turn out to be worse than you had expected, but you have

the moat as your backstop. The no-moat company, in

contrast, has to overcome larger odds to succeed—man-

agement needs to be just as good as you expect (if not

better) in order to succeed in a tough competitive envi-

ronment, and if the CEO turns out to be a lesser light,

the company’s performance has nowhere to go but down.

Think about it this way: Which is easier to change,

the industry a company is in or its managers? The answer,

course, is obvious—executives come and go with regular-

ity, but a company in a tough industry is stuck there for

good. And since we know that some industries have

structurally better economics than others, it stands to

reason that the industry in which a company operates will

likely have a bigger impact on its ability to generate high

and sustainable returns on capital than will the CEO at

the helm.

Management matters, but within boundaries set by

companies’ structural competitive advantages. No CEO

operates in a vacuum, and while great managers can add

to the value of a business, management by itself is not a

sustainable competitive advantage.

THE BIG BOSS [141]

The Bottom Line

1. Bet on the horse, not the jockey. Management

matters, but far less than moats.

2. Investing is all about odds, and a wide-moat com-

pany managed by an average CEO will give you

better odds of long-run success than a no-moat

company managed by a superstar.

Big-picture, abstract concepts went in one ear and out the

other unless I could hang those ideas on concrete exam-

and although I slogged through the great political think-

ers like Max Weber, Karl Marx, and Émile Durkheim,

I can’t say I enjoyed them (aside from Joseph “creative

destruction” Schumpeter, of course). By contrast, I loved

reading books that took diverse bits of evidence and teased

out a unifying theme or theory from the ground up. I’ve

never really connected the dots before, but it was in hind-

sight a good prelude to a career as a bottom-up fundamental

securities analyst.

In this chapter, I want to take all of the ideas about

economic moats that I’ve thrown out so far and put them

to the test by looking at five companies one by one, from

the bottom up. After all, this is how you’ll likely apply the

ideas from this book in real life. You’ll read about a com-

pany in a business magazine or hear it mentioned by a

portfolio manager or colleague, and you’ll be intrigued

enough to do a little digging on your own. With that in

mind, I picked the companies in this chapter in as realis-

tic a manner as I could think of—I grabbed a few recent

issues of major investing publications like F ortune and

Barron’s, and picked five companies that were mentioned

favorably.

Exhibit 1 1.1 shows the three-step process I’ll be using

to determine whether these companies have moats. Step

one is “show me the money”—has the company generated

decent returns on capital in the past? When you’re analyz-

ing this, look at returns on capital over as long a period of

time as possible, as a poor year or two does not disqualify
