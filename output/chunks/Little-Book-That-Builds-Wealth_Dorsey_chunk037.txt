a company from having a moat. (You can see 10 years of

financial data free on M orningstar.com. )

If not, and the future is not likely to be appreciably

different from the past, there is no moat. After all, a com-

petitive advantage should show up in the numbers, and a

firm that has not yet demonstrated the ability to earn an

excess economic return is not one to pin your hopes on. It

is possible that a company that has posted subpar returns

on capital in the past may be poised for better days going

forward, but such optimism would need to be accompa-

nied by a large and positive shift in the underlying eco-

nomics of the business. It does happen, and you can make

a lot of money by identifying companies that have struc-

turally changed for the better, but companies like these

are much more the exception than the rule.

So no evidence of solid returns on capital generally

equals no moat. But if a company has posted good returns

on capital, our job becomes trickier. Step two in the pro-

cess is identifying a competitive advantage—that is, figuring

out why the company has been able to fend off competitors

and generate excess economic returns. After all, it’s entirely

possible that even a company with a record of good

returns on capital might not have a moat if there’s no spe-

cific reason why those returns will persist into the future.

If we didn’t think about why high returns will stay high,

we would just be driving by looking in the rearview mirror,

which is rarely a good idea. Think about retailers and

restaurant chains—switching costs for consumers are

extremely low, so companies in these industries need scale,

a well-established brand, or some other defensible advan-

tage to give them a moat. Without an advantage, those high

returns on capital could dissipate very quickly—h istory is

full of hot retail or restaurant concepts that have flopped

after a few years of early success.

This second step is where we need to apply all of the

tools of competitive analysis. Does the company have a

brand? Patents? Is it tough for customers to switch to

competing products? Does it have sustainably lower costs?

Does it benefit from network economics? Is it subject to

technological disruption or a shift in industry dynamics?

And so forth.

Assuming we’ve found some evidence of competitive

advantage, step three is figuring out just how durable

that advantage is likely to be. Some moats are real, but

they may be easy to bridge, while some are wide enough that

we can forecast high returns on capital for many years

into the future with confidence. This is without question

a subjective call, which is why I don’t advocate slicing

things too finely. At Morningstar, we divide companies

into just three categories: wide moat, narrow moat, and

no moat. I’ll do the same in the examples that follow.

Now, let’s put these ideas into action.

Hunting for Moats

Our first example is Deere & Company, which makes the

eponymous agricultural equipment and also has a fair-

sized segment selling construction machinery. As you can

see in Exhibit 1 1.2 , Deere has cranked out some pretty solid

returns on capital over the past decade, despite a nasty

downturn from 1999 to 2002. Agriculture is a cyclical

business, so this shouldn’t be too much of a concern—if

Deere sold something with much steadier demand, like

cheese or beer, we’d want to investigate further. So, based

on the numbers, it looks like Deere has a moat.

Now we move on to competitive analysis—what is it about

Deere that has allowed it to generate solid returns on capital,

and are those returns likely to be sustained into the future?

Well, the brand certainly helps. The company has been around

for 170 years, and farmers are typically extremely loyal to the

Deere brand. However, users of products from Deere’s com-

petitors, Case Construction Equipment and New Holland,

are loyal, too, so there must be more to the story.

WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD [149]

The key, as it turns out, is Deere’s vast dealer network,

which is much more extensive in North America than those

of competitors. Dealers can quickly source parts and com-

plete repairs on Deere equipment, which minimizes down-

time during critical planting and harvesting seasons. The

ability to get broken equipment up and running in short

order is critical given that Deere’s customers are extremely

time-sensitive—a farmer might use a $300,000 combine for

only a few weeks out of the year, but the machine abso-

lutely, positively has to be running smoothly during those

few weeks. Because replicating this dealer network would

be possible for a competitor, and farmers might switch

brands if Deere’s quality slipped substantially, it’s hard to

say that Deere has a wide economic moat. But it would

take years for a competitor to be able to do this, and it’s not

certain that a competitor actually will. So, I’d say Deere
