order is critical given that Deere’s customers are extremely

time-sensitive—a farmer might use a $300,000 combine for

only a few weeks out of the year, but the machine abso-

lutely, positively has to be running smoothly during those

few weeks. Because replicating this dealer network would

be possible for a competitor, and farmers might switch

brands if Deere’s quality slipped substantially, it’s hard to

say that Deere has a wide economic moat. But it would

take years for a competitor to be able to do this, and it’s not

certain that a competitor actually will. So, I’d say Deere

has a narrow but solid economic moat, and we can have

some confidence that the company will continue to gener-

ate solid returns on capital for some time into the future.

Our next example takes us from the heartland to the

Hamptons—Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, which

licenses the Martha Stewart brand and also produces

magazines and TV shows. Given Martha’s popularity—

even after a brief sojourn in the pokey—we might expect

the company to be pretty profitable. Let’s check the num-

bers by referring to Exhibit 11.3 .

Hmm. Not very impressive, are they? At first glance,

it’s a bit of a concern that even in Martha’s heyday, before

she ran afoul of the law, the company generated less than

a 13 percent return on equity. While that’s not a terrible

return on capital, we should expect better from a business

that doesn’t have a whole lot of invested capital to begin

with. After all, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia pro-

duces a magazine and a TV show, and licenses the brand

to other companies; it doesn’t own a whole bunch of fac-

tories or expensive inventory. So, despite the resurgent

popularity of the Martha Stewart brand, I have to con-

clude that her company has no economic moat. And that’s

not a good thing.

Moving from a firm without much invested capital to

one with a whole lot of it, let’s take a look at Arch Coal,

the country’s second-largest coal producer. It’s generally

tough for commodity firms to dig an economic moat, so

we’ll probably be a bit skeptical when we start the analy-

sis. Looking at the numbers, however, returns on capital

have shown modest improvement to decent, if not great,

levels. Looks like things started looking up for Arch in

2004, while both 2006 and 2007 showed solid results.

See Exhibit 11.4.

Let’s dig in further to see whether the past couple of

years were an aberration, and returns on capital are likely

to fall back to sub-par levels, or whether something has

structurally changed for the better at Arch. First of all, it

seems that Arch sold a bunch of money-losing mines in

Central Appalachia in late 2005, which is positive for future

returns on capital. Second, Arch is one of four companies

that essentially control the supply of coal produced from an

area called the Powder River Basin in Wyoming, and coal

from this area is in demand from utilities because it has a

very low sulfur content, and sulfur is one of the major pol-

lutants that get emitted when coal is burned.

Now all of this is well and good, but if Arch were

only competing with other firms producing coal in the

Powder River Basin, it wouldn’t have a moat unless it was

producing coal at a sustainably lower cost than its peers

in the area. (It’s not, by the way.) However, coal from the

[152] THE LITTLE BOOK THAT BUILDS WEALTH

Powder River Basin is much cheaper to produce than coal

mined in many other parts of the U.S.—even after you take

into account the higher transport costs, since the Powder

River Basin is pretty far from high-population areas that

consume lots of coal. And in a commodity business, if

you can produce something at a sustainably lower cost than

other companies selling the same product, you may very

well have a moat.

So, why aren’t we seeing this cost advantage in Arch’s

historical returns on capital? Well, it turns out that Arch

signed some long-term contracts at much lower prices years

ago, and those contracts are just starting to expire and be

replaced by new contracts at much higher prices—which

means that future returns on capital should be substantially

higher than past returns. So, I think we can provisionally

assign Arch a narrow economic moat, but it’s a moat that

we’d want to watch pretty closely. If production costs in the

Powder River Basin increase considerably, or if the govern-

ment introduces regulations that make coal less attractive as

a resource by imposing a carbon tax, we’d want to re-evaluate

things. But based on what we know today, Arch seems to

have a (very) narrow moat.

Our fourth company isn’t as well-known as the first

three, but we can learn a lot about moats from looking at it.
