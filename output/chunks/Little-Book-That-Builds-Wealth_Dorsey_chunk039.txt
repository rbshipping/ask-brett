assign Arch a narrow economic moat, but it’s a moat that

we’d want to watch pretty closely. If production costs in the

Powder River Basin increase considerably, or if the govern-

ment introduces regulations that make coal less attractive as

a resource by imposing a carbon tax, we’d want to re-evaluate

things. But based on what we know today, Arch seems to

have a (very) narrow moat.

Our fourth company isn’t as well-known as the first

three, but we can learn a lot about moats from looking at it.

The Fastenal Company distributes a wide variety of mainte-

nance, repair, and operations products to manufacturers and

contractors around the United States. It does this through a

network of about 2,000 stores, and specializes in fasteners,

as the company’s name implies. That may sound like a dull

business, but let’s check out the numbers to be sure. (See

Exhibit 11.5 .)

Wow! Whatever you might think of the business, those

are not dull numbers. An average return on equity of more

than 20 percent over a decade, with minimal financial

leverage, is a highly uncommon achievement. In fact, out

of the 3,000 stocks in Morningstar’s database with market

capitalizations over $500 million, only 50 have similar track

records of generating tremendous returns on capital. The

question, of course, is whether Fastenal just got lucky or

built a competitive advantage that will allow it to maintain

such high returns on capital.

When you dig into the company, it turns out that Fas-

tenal benefits from location-based scale economies similar

to the cement and aggregate companies discussed in

Chapter 7 . Fasteners, such as screws, anchors, and bolts,

are heavy and expensive to ship and they don’t cost very

much, which means that Fastenal gets a big cost advan-

tage from having lots of stores close to its customers.

Proximity also means that Fastenal usually has a quicker

delivery time than competitors, which is another big

advantage given that manufacturers typically need fasten-

ers when something breaks, and downtime is a very expen-

sive proposition for these firms.

With twice as many locations as its nearest competitor,

Fastenal seems able to maintain its scale advantage, espe-

cially because it essentially dominates hundreds of small

geographic niches that would not be profitable enough by

themselves for a competitor to attack. The company also

maintains an in-house truck fleet that allows it to distribute

products to its stores—and to customers’ job sites—at much

lower cost than if it used a third-party shipper like UPS.

So, to take on Fastenal, a competitor would need a similarly

scaled distribution network plus a willingness to build non-

economic stores in Fastenal markets that are only large

enough for a single distributor. That sounds like a pretty

daunting task, which is why I think Fastenal is a wide-moat

business with the potential to crank out a superior return

on capital for many years into the future.

For the final example, I want to show you why it is so

important to think about the competitive dynamics of a

business, in addition to looking at its track record of

generating solid returns on capital. If you had looked at

either of these two businesses in 2004 or so, you would

have licked your lips over the returns on capital. Company

B’s track record was not quite as consistent as Company A’s,

but the trend was certainly in the right direction. (See

Exhibit 11.6 and Exhibit 11.7 .)

Company A is Pier 1 Imports, and Company B is

Hot Topic, two retailers that were hitting on all cylinders

in the late 1990s and the early part of the current decade.

Both were growing nicely—Hot Topic at a phenomenal

40(cid:2) percent pace, and Pier 1 at a more measured mid-

teens rate—and both were cranking out very respectable

returns on capital. But let’s think about the nature of

their businesses. Pier 1 sells imported furniture and home

accessories, and Hot Topic is a teen clothing retailer with

a very specific look to its wares—both decent businesses, as

long as the companies do a good job managing invento-

ries and staying on top of consumer trends. However, it

would have been a stretch to confidently predict that

Pier 1 and Hot Topic could maintain such high returns

on capital for a long time, as switching costs for their con-

sumers are essentially nil.

It turns out that you would have been right to be

skeptical. (See Exhibit 11.8 and Exhibit 11.9 .)
