accessories, and Hot Topic is a teen clothing retailer with

a very specific look to its wares—both decent businesses, as

long as the companies do a good job managing invento-

ries and staying on top of consumer trends. However, it

would have been a stretch to confidently predict that

Pier 1 and Hot Topic could maintain such high returns

on capital for a long time, as switching costs for their con-

sumers are essentially nil.

It turns out that you would have been right to be

skeptical. (See Exhibit 11.8 and Exhibit 11.9 .)

WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD [157]

Both companies have fallen off a cliff over the past few

years, in terms of both returns on capital and stock price.

(From early 2005 to mid-2007, Hot Topic’s stock price was

cut in half, and Pier 1’s stock is down a painful 75 per-

cent.) The story was the same in both cases—consumers

stopped buying what the companies were selling as trends

moved in different directions (and for Pier 1, competition

heated up as well). Retail is a tough business—easy come,

easy go.

Although I used retailers in this example, I could have

picked a smaller technology company just as easily—or

really any company without a structural competitive advan-

tage. The point is that unless a company has some kind of

economic moat, predicting how much shareholder value it

will create in the future is pretty much a crapshoot, regard-

less of what the historical track record looks like. Looking

at the numbers is a start, but it’s only a start. Thinking

carefully about the strength of the company’s competitive

advantage, and how it will (or won’t) be able to keep the

competition at bay, is a critical next step.

At this point, you have all the tools you need to start

separating wonderful businesses from companies with

more uncertain futures. But how will you know when

those businesses are trading at attractive prices? That’s

the subject of our next two chapters.

[158] THE LITTLE BOOK THAT BUILDS WEALTH

The Bottom Line

1. T o see if a company has an economic moat, first

check its historical track record of generating

returns on capital. Strong returns indicate that

the company may have a moat, while poor returns

point to a lack of competitive advantage—unless

the company’s business has changed substantially.

2. If historical returns on capital are strong, ask

yourself how the company will maintain them.

Apply the tools of competitive analysis from

Chapters 3 to 7, and try to identify a moat. If you

can’t identify a specific reason why returns on

capital will stay strong, the company likely does

not have a moat.

3. If you can identify a moat, think about how

strong it is and how long it will last. Some moats

last for decades, while others are less durable.

businesses with economic moats, making money in the

stock is critically important to your future investment returns,

which is why step 2 of the game plan I wrote about way

back on the first page of the Introduction read: “Wait

until the shares of those businesses trade for less than

their intrinsic value, and buy.”

Valuation is a funny thing. I’ve met lots of very intelli-

gent investors who could quote me chapter and verse

about the companies whose shares they owned, or were

thinking of buying, but couldn’t answer a simple ques-

tion: “So, what’s it worth?” The same individuals who

will haggle for hours over a car, or drive a mile out of

their way to save a few cents per gallon on a tank of gas,

will buy stocks with only a vague sense of the potential

value of the business.

The reason for this, I think, is simply that valuing a

stock is hard—and pretty uncertain, even for professionals—

so most people just throw in the towel and don’t try. After

all, it’s easy to know if a gas station or car dealer is giving

you a good deal, because you know what similar products

are selling for. If a dealer wants $40,000 for that new

Lexus and other dealers are selling it for $42,000, it’s the

same car so you can be reasonably confident that you’re not

overpaying at $40,000. But in valuing companies, we run

into two hurdles.

First, every company is slightly different, which makes

comparisons tough. Growth rates, returns on capital,

strength of competitive advantage, and a host of other

factors all affect the value of a business, so comparing two

companies with each other is likely to be a difficult exercise.

(It is useful in some cases—more on that later in this chapter.)

Second, the value of a company is directly tied to its

future financial performance, which is unknown, though

we can obviously make some educated guesses. For these
