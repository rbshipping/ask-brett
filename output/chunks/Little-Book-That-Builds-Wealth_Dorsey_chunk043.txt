As you can see, a change in the market’s mood—the

speculative return—caused a drastically different outcome for

an investor who bought shares of two companies in the same

industry that posted roughly the same growth rate over the

past decade. The Microsoft investor has received returns

roughly in line with the market, while the Adobe investor has

made several times his or her initial investment.

Now, the Adobe example is an extreme; buying a

stock with the expectation that the market will deliver

a massive speculative return is folly. But by purchasing

shares at a P/E of 17 a decade ago (versus a P/E of 50 for

Mister Softee), the buyer of Adobe minimized the risk of

the negative speculative return that whacked the buyer

of Microsoft shares over the past 10 years. The fact that

the lucky Adobe buyer benefited from a huge increase

in the P/E ratio is gravy.

This is why valuation is so important. By paying close

attention to valuation, you’re maximizing the impact of some-

thing you can forecast (a company’s financial performance)

on your future investment returns, and minimizing the

impact of something you can’t forecast (the enthusiasm or

pessimism of other investors). Besides, who doesn’t like

getting a deal?

The Bottom Line

1. A company’s value is equal to all the cash it will

generate in the future. That’s it.

WHAT’S A MOAT WORTH? [169]

2. The four most important factors that affect the

valuation of any company are how much cash it

will generate (growth), the certainty attached to

those estimated cash flows (risk), the amount of

investment needed to run the business (return on

capital), and the amount of time the company can

keep competitors at bay (economic moat).

3. Buying stocks with low valuations helps insulate

you from the market’s whims, because it ties your

future investment returns more tightly to the

financial performance of the company.

— — that valuation is critical

AVING I HOPE CONVINCED YOU

to ensuring that your careful competitive analysis pays off

in attractive portfolio returns, let’s look at price multiples,

our first tool. Multiples are simultaneously the most com-

monly used and the most commonly m isused valuation tool.

The most basic multiple is the price-to-sales (P/S)

ratio, which is just the current price of a stock divided by

sales per share. The nice thing about the price-to-sales

ratio is that just about all companies have sales, even when

business is temporarily in the dumps—which makes P/S

particularly u seful for cyclical companies or companies

that are having some kind of trouble that sends earnings

temporarily into the red. The trick with the P/S ratio,

however, is that a dollar of sales may be worth a little or a

lot, depending on how profitable the company is. Low-

margin businesses, such as retailers, typically have very

low P/S ratios relative to high-margin businesses like soft-

ware or pharmaceuticals. So, don’t use price-to-sales ratios

to compare companies in different industries, or you’ll

wind up thinking that the lowest-margin companies are all

great bargains, while the high-margin ones are too expensive.

In my opinion, the P/S ratio is most useful for compa-

nies that have temporarily depressed margins, or that have

room for a lot of improvement in margins. Remember

that high margins mean more earnings per dollar of sales,

which leads to a higher P/S ratio. So, if you run across

a low-margin company with a P/S ratio in line with similar

low-margin companies and you think the company can cut

costs and boost profitability significantly, you might have

a cheap stock in your sights.

In fact, one useful way to use the price-to-sales ratio

is to find high-margin companies that have hit a speed

bump. Companies that have been able to post fat margins

in the past, but which have low current P/S ratios, may be

discounted by the market because other investors assume

the decline in profitability is permanent. If in fact the

company can return to its former level of profitability,

then the stock is probably quite cheap. This is one use for

which the price-to-sales ratio can be a better tool than the

price-earnings ratio; the P/E on a stock that is under-

earning its potential would be high (because E is low), so

looking for low P/Es wouldn’t uncover these kinds of

out-of-favor stocks.

Hitting the Books

The second common multiple is the price-to-book (P/B)

ratio, which compares the company’s market price with

its book value, which is also called shareholders’ equity.

Think of book value as representing all the physical capi-

tal invested in the company—factories, computers, real

estate, inventory, you name it. The rationale for using

book value in certain cases is that future earnings and

cash flows are ephemeral, while the stuff that a company

physically owns has a more tangible and certain value.

The key to using the P/B ratio in valuing stocks is to

think carefully about what “B” represents. Whereas a

dollar of earnings or cash flow is exactly the same from

Company A to Company B, the stuff that makes up book

value can vary dramatically. For an asset-intensive firm

like a railroad or a manufacturing firm, book value repre-

sents the bulk of the assets that generate revenue—things

like locomotives, factories, and inventory. But for a service

or technology firm, for example, the revenue-generating

assets are people, ideas, and processes, none of which are

generally contained in book value.

Moreover, many of the competitive advantages that
