its debt, and kept the free cash flow. Going back to our

apartment-building analogy from the preceding chapter,

think of cash return as the income stream, as a percentage

of the purchase price, that you might get from owning an

apartment building outright after paying for maintenance

and upkeep. Cash return tells us how much free cash

flow a company is generating relative to the cost of buy-

ing the whole company, including its debt burden.

This measure improves on the earnings yield because it

looks at free cash flow (owner earnings) and incorporates

debt into the company’s capital structure. To calculate cash

return, add free cash flow (cash flow from operations,

minus capital expenditures) to net interest expense (interest

expense minus interest income). That’s the top half of the

ratio. The bottom half is called “enterprise value,” which is

the company’s market capitalization (equity) plus long-term

debt, minus any cash on the balance sheet. Divide free cash

flow plus net interest by enterprise value, and there you

go—cash return.

As an example, let’s take a quick look at Covidien

Ltd., a huge health-care company that was part of Tyco

International before that company broke itself up. In

2007, Covidien posted about $2 billion in free cash flow,

and it paid about $300 million in interest. So, $2 billion

plus $300 million equals $2.3 billion, and there’s the

top half of the ratio. The company has a market cap of

$20 billion and long-term debt of about $4.6 billion, and

the sum of those numbers, less $700 million in cash on the

balance sheet, is Covidien’s enterprise value of $23.9 billion.

We divide $2.3 billion by $23.9 billion, and we get a cash

return of 9.6 percent, which is pretty juicy considering

that that cash stream should grow over time, because

Covidien sells into a number of health-care markets with

solid prospects.

So, now you have a number of valuation tools at your

disposal—multiples and yields—and you should have an

idea of when each is useful and when it’s not. How do you

put these together to decide whether the price of a stock

is less than its value?

The short answer is “very carefully.” The long answer

is that it takes practice and a fair amount of trial and

error to become skilled at identifying undervalued stocks,

but I think the following five tips will give you better odds

of success than most investors.

1. Always remember the four drivers of valuation: risk,

return on capital, competitive advantage, and growth.

All else being equal, you should pay less for riskier

stocks, more for companies with high returns on

capital, more for companies with strong competitive

advantages, and more for companies with higher

growth prospects.

Bear in mind that these drivers compound each

other. A company that has the potential to grow

for a long time, with low capital investment, little

cc1133..iinndddd 118822 11//2288//0088 77::2277::3311 PPMM

TOOLS FOR VALUATION [183]

competition, and reasonable risk, is potentially

worth a l ot more than one with similar growth pros-

pects but lower returns on capital and an uncertain

competitive outlook. Investors who focus blindly

on the popular P/E-to-growth (PEG) ratio usually

miss this key point, because they are forgetting that

growth at a high return on capital is much more

valuable than growth at a low return on capital.

2. Use multiple tools. If one ratio or metric indicates

that the company is cheap, apply another as well.

The stars won’t always align, but when they do, it’s

a good indication that you’ve found a truly under-

valued company.

3. Be patient. Wonderful businesses do not trade at

great prices very often, but as Warren Buffett has

said, “There are no called strikes in investing.”

Have a watch list of wonderful businesses that you

would love to own at the right price, wait for that

price, and then pounce. Although you don’t want

to be too picky—opportunity does have a cost—

remember one thing when the decision is not clear:

Not making money beats l osing money any day of

the week.

4. Be tough. The odds are good that the world will be

telling you not to invest at precisely the time that

you should. Wonderful businesses do not trade for

great prices when the headlines are positive and

Wall Street is cheery; they get cheap when the

news is bad and investors overreact. You’ll have to

buy when everyone else is selling, which is not easy.

It is profitable, though, and that’s the nice thing

about it.

5. Be yourself. You will make better investment deci-

sions based on your own hard-won knowledge about

a company than you will decisions based on any pun-

dit’s tips. The reason is simple. If you understand

the source of a company’s economic moat and you

think the business is trading for less than its value, it

will be much easier for you to make the tough

against-the-grain decisions required of a successful

investor. If, however, you are constantly relying on

the tips and advice of others without doing some

research on your own, you’ll be constantly questioning

whether that advice is any good, and you’ll probably

buy high and sell low.

The best business in the world will be a bad invest-

ment if purchased at an unattractive price. Ask anyone

who bought Coke or Cisco in 1999 or 2000—they were

great businesses then, and they still are today, but their

valuations were so high that there was no room for error

or for profit. Buying a stock without close attention to

valuation is like buying a car without looking at the sticker
