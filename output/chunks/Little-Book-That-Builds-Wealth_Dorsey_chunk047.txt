buy high and sell low.

The best business in the world will be a bad invest-

ment if purchased at an unattractive price. Ask anyone

who bought Coke or Cisco in 1999 or 2000—they were

great businesses then, and they still are today, but their

valuations were so high that there was no room for error

or for profit. Buying a stock without close attention to

TOOLS FOR VALUATION [185]

valuation is like buying a car without looking at the sticker

price. If you buy the car, at least you get to enjoy driving

it, but buying stocks that are too expensive carries no

such side benefit. Make sure valuation is a tailwind for

your stock picks rather than a headwind.

The Bottom Line

1. T he price-to-sales ratio is most useful for com-

panies that are temporarily unprofitable or are

posting lower profit margins than they could. If

a company with the potential for better margins

has a very low price-to-sales ratio, you might have

a cheap stock in your sights.

2. The price-to-book ratio is most useful for finan-

cial services firms, because the book value of these

companies more closely reflects the actual tangible

value of their business. Be wary of extremely low

price-to-book ratios, because they can indicate

that the book value may be questionable.

3. Always be aware of which “E” is being used for

a P/E ratio, because forecasts don’t always come

true. The best “E” to use is your own: Look at

how the company has performed in good times

and bad, think about whether the future will be

a lot better or worse than the past, and come up

with your own estimate of how much the com-

pany could earn in an average year.

4. R atios of price to cash flow can help you spot

companies that spit out lots of cash relative to

earnings. It is best for companies that get cash up

front, but it can overstate profitability for compa-

nies with lots of hard assets that depreciate and

will need to be replaced someday.

5. Y ield-based valuations are useful because you

can compare the results directly with alternative

investments, like bonds.

When to Sell

(cid:1)

Smart Selling Means

Better Returns.

W

-1990s, I came across a small company

AYBACKINTHEMID

called EMC Corporation that sold computer storage equip-

ment. I did some research on the stock, and I decided that

although it was a bit pricey at about 20 times earnings, strong

demand for data storage, combined with the EMC’s solid

market position, meant that it should grow at a pretty rapid

clip. So I bought a pretty good-sized position for my piddling

portfolio.

[188] THE LITTLE BOOK THAT BUILDS WEALTH

I then watched the stock go from $5 to $100 in three

years—and right back to $5 a year later. I sold about a

third of my position at a pretty high price, but I watched

the majority come right back down again. I had made a

great purchase decision, but my overall return on the

investment would have been far, far better had I been

smarter about selling.

Ask any professional investor what he or she thinks is

the hardest part of investing, and most will tell you that

knowing when to sell ranks up there near the top—if not

right at the top. In this chapter, I want to give you a road

map for selling well, because selling a stock at the right

time, and for the right reasons, is just as important to

your investment returns as buying a stock with a lot of

upside potential.

S ell for the Right Reasons

Ask yourself these questions the next time you think

about selling, and if you can’t answer yes to one or more,

don’t sell.

• Did I make a mistake?

• Has the company changed for the worse?

• Is there a better place for my money?

• Has the stock become too large a portion of my

portfolio?

WHEN TO SELL [189]

Perhaps the most painful reason to sell is that you were

simply wrong. But if you missed something significant

when you first analyzed the company—whatever it was—

then your original investment thesis may very well not hold

water. Maybe you thought management would be able to

turn around or sell a money-losing division, but instead the

company decided to plow more money into that segment.

Perhaps you thought the company had a strong competi-

tive advantage, but then the competition started eating its

lunch; or maybe you overestimated the success of a new

product. No matter what the mistake was, it’s rarely worth

hanging on to a stock that you bought for a reason that is

no longer valid. Cut your losses and move on.

I did just this many years ago with a company that

manufactured commercial movie projectors. The com-

pany had strong market share and a good track record,

and multiscreen theaters were springing up like weeds

across the country. Unfortunately, my growth expecta-

tions turned out to be way too high, because the multiplex-

building boom was waning. Theater owners started to get

into financial trouble, and they were a lot more worried

about paying their bills—especially the interest on their

debt—than they were in building new theaters. I was down

quite a bit on the investment by the time I figured this

out, but I sold anyway. Good thing I did, too, because the

shares subsequently plunged to penny-stock territory.

I should note that this is far easier said than done,

because we tend to anchor on the price at which we bought
