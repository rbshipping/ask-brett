in your portfolio do some of the heavy lifting for you in

terms of investment returns. Companies with strong com-

petitive advantages can regularly post returns on capital

of 20(cid:1) percent, which is a rate of return that very few

money managers can achieve over long periods of time. *

The opportunity to become part owner of enterprises that

can compound capital at such a rate—especially if your

ownership stakes are purchased for 80 cents on the dollar—

has the potential to build a lot of wealth over time.

One thing many people don’t realize about investing is

that it’s not just a numbers game. You do need to under-

stand some basic accounting to get the most out of financial

statements, but I’ve known some pretty smart accountants

who weren’t much good at analyzing businesses or picking

stocks. Understanding how cash flows through a company,

*As of mid-2007, exactly 24 nonsector funds out of more than 5,550 in

Morningstar’s database had managed to generate annualized returns above

15 percent over the past 15 years—not an easy task.

MORE THAN NUMBERS [199]

and how that process is reflected in the financial statements,

is necessary, but by no means sufficient.

To be a truly good investor, you need to read widely.

The major business press—the W all Street Journal, Fortune,

Barron’s— is a good start, because it helps you to expand

your mental database of companies. The more companies

you are familiar with, the easier it will be to make compari-

sons, find patterns, and see themes that strengthen or

weaken competitive advantages. I would argue strongly that

reading about companies will add infinitely more value to

your investment process than will reading about short-term

market movements, macroeconomic trends, or interest-rate

forecasts. One annual report is worth 10 speeches by a

Federal Reserve chairman.

Once you’ve made these publications part of your invest-

ment diet, move on to books about—and by—successful money

managers. There’s no substitute for learning about investing

from people ‘who have practiced it successfully, after all.

Quarterly shareholder letters are valuable for the same rea-

son, and they have the added benefit of being free. In my

opinion, the quarterly letters written by solid money manag-

ers about their portfolios are some of the most underused

investment resources on the planet—and given the price,

they are certainly worth more than you’re paying for them.

Finally, there is a burgeoning literature about how

people make investment decisions, and why that process

[200] THE LITTLE BOOK THAT BUILDS WEALTH

is often filled with hidden biases. Books like Why Smart

People Make Big Money Mistakes—and How to Correct Them

by Gary Belsky and Thomas Gilovich (Simon & Schuster,

1999); T he Halo Effect by Phil Rosenzweig (Simon &

Schuster, 2007); and Y our Money and Your Brain by Jason

Zweig (Simon & Schuster, 2007) will help you see the

flaws in your own decision-making process, and will help

you make smarter decisions about your investments.

I hope that the ideas in this book will do the same.
