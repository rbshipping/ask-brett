AAR- JUNE SALE SET UP, DURING AND PACK DOWN

What we did well:

Staggering of mark downs going live.

Sale boxes delivered with sale stickers on it.

Sale stock coming in boxes in price points

Sale pack clear and easy to read- was great getting a RM & SM to read over

Sale transfers taking place prior

Regional team getting together with SM to sign off a store

Loved getting the sales report comparing to last sale.

Conference call with national to all SM discussing pack

Planning- the inventory management and offer has been fantastic

National emailed regionals what the rosters should look like on grading of stores. SM to sign off every roster.

Markdown was clear to stores.

Signage guide for pack down was good

3 FOR 2- told stores in advance it was coming up, so they can order signage needed.

Communication for planning

Smoothing out sale transfers

Sale transfers were managed well

List of priority changes when packing down sale

Spreading out mark downs was good

As stores got less, it was good when we combined the frame with wrist, neck & ring
