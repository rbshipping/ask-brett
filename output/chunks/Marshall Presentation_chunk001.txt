Teaching leaders what to

STOP

“We spend a lot of time

helping leaders learn

what to do,

we don’t spend enough

time helping leaders learn

what to stop.”

Peter Drucker

Classic challenges

for successful leaders

• Winning too much

• Adding too much value

• ‘I already knew that’

• Passing too much judgment

What percent of all interpersonal

communication time is spent on…

• People talking about how smart,

special or wonderful they are (or

listening to someone do this)

PLUS

• People talking about how stupid,

inept or bad someone else is (or

listening to someone do this)?

Using small amounts of money

to create large changes in behavior

• No, but, however

BUT

• Great,

• Destructive comments

• No, I agree!

Learning from a great leader

• The most important factor for successful

change is the client – not the coach

• Don’t make coaching about your own ego.

• If they don’t care – don’t waste your time.

• If you don’t care – don’t waste your time.

Coaching practice

• What one behavior change will make

a significant positive difference for

you?

• Why will this change make a

difference?

• Repeat with your partner.

• The feedforward exercise

• Letting go of the past

• Listening to suggestions without

judging

• Learning as much as you can

• Helping as much as you can

• Learning points to help you be a

great coach

Coaching practice

• What is your behavior for change?

• What did you learn in the

feedforward process?

• What are you going to do about it?

• Solicit ideas that will help to ensure

‘back on the job’ execution

• Repeat the process with your

partner

Developing yourself

as a leader and partner

• ASK

• LISTEN

• THINK

• THANK

• RESPOND

• INVOLVE

• CHANGE

• FOLLOW-UP

ASK

• Why don’t we ask:

– At work?

– At home?

• Case studies at home

• Who great leaders need to ask

LISTEN

• The first thing that we want to do – is

the last thing that we should do

• Stop:

– Asking for input - then expressing my

opinion

– Making excuses

• Classic challenges for leaders

THINK

• The Frances Hesselbein story

• Avoid ‘speaking when angry or out of

control’

• Hard at work – even harder at home

THANK

• Avoid ‘punishing the messenger’

– The ‘correcting my driving’ case study

– Why do we punish people who are trying

to help us?

• Two very different examples of asking

for input:

– Negative – the operating room

– Positive – the fighter jet

RESPOND

• Responding to 360° feedback:

– Positive

– Simple

– Focused

– Fast

• Ask for ideas for the future – not more

feedback about the past

• Promise to listen and think – not to do

everything that people suggest

INVOLVE

• Keys to successful behavioral change:

– Set a clear goal

– Write down the goal

– Publicly state the goal

– Measure your success in goal

achievement

Involve a support group in

–

helping you achieve the goal

CHANGE

• After 12 years - a great question

• Can people change? Definitely

• Will people change? Maybe

• 28 years in determining an answer

duration

clients

Contact Sport”

Changing perception

• Why changing perception is more

difficult than changing behavior

• How follow-up leads to a long-term

change in perception – as well as

behavior

• The Roman numeral watch case study

The ‘Is it worth it?’ exercise

• Pick a key behavior

• What will be one benefit when you

get better at this?

• Go to the next person
