change in perception – as well as

behavior

• The Roman numeral watch case study

The ‘Is it worth it?’ exercise

• Pick a key behavior

• What will be one benefit when you

get better at this?

• Go to the next person

• Repeat the process

When behavioral coaching

will not work

• The person doesn’t want to

change

• “Written-off” by the company

• Lacks business or technical

knowledge

• Wrong strategy or direction

• Integrity or ethics violations

• Person in wrong job - company

Coaching

for behavioral change

• Involve the person (and boss) in

determining key stakeholders.

• Recruit key stakeholders to be part of

the change process:

– Let go of the past

– Be positive and supportive

– Tell the truth

– Two-way improvement

Coaching

for behavioral change

• Collect feedback.

• Analyze results.

• Have the person respond to key stakeholders.

• Provide ongoing suggestions.

• Follow-up.

• Conduct a mini-survey to measure change.

Team building

without time wasting

• Determining ‘where we are’ vs. ‘where we

want to be’

• Choosing team-wide behavior for change

• Feedforward with team members

• Deciding on individual area for change

• The three question follow-up process

• Measuring positive change

What happens?

• If we know the people that we want to

become

• Why don’t we become these people?

• Millions of employees around the world:

– Disengaged

– Depressed

– Not achieving personal goals

• Many teams and organizations are

dysfunctional

Why is change so difficult?

• New Year’s resolutions that are never

achieved?

• Coaching clients that don’t change?

• Our daily failures to do – even the small

things – that we plan?

What is a trigger?

TRIGGER –

ANY STIMULUS

THAT MAY IMPACT OUR BEHAVIOR

Who is in control?

Control

walk creates me

Low External Control High

Mutual creation

I am creating my world

and at the same time

triggers in my world

are creating me

Fate vs. choice

• Fate – The hand of cards that we

have been dealt.

• Choice – How we play the hand.

Dealing with triggers

• The negative case – correcting driving

• The positive case – the hard day

Triggers: today’s ‘perfect storm’

for distraction

• Emails, cell phones, tablets, texting

• On demand TV, movies, games

• Social media

• Multi-tasking

• ‘The dream’

Classic delusions

• Planner bias, understanding – doing gap

• It won’t take that long or be that hard

• High probability of low probability

distractions

• I have willpower and won’t become

depleted

• I don’t need help or structure to achieve

my goals

It is OK to need

help and structure

• The changing role of coaching – from

‘fixing losers’ to ‘helping winners’

• 27 top executive endorsements

• Athletes, movie stars, world leaders

• If could have fixed it by yourself, it

would probably be fixed by now

• ‘I need help and it is OK!’

The value of structure

• The Checklist Manifesto

• Stakeholder centered coaching process

• Six question coaching

• Alan Mulally process

• Daily question process

Six Question Coaching

1. Where are we going?

2. Where are you going?

3. Doing well?

4. Suggestions for improvement?

5. How can I help?

6. Suggestions for me?

Mutual Responsibility

Alan Mulally:

the Ford turnaround story

Establishing clear leadership behavior:

•Determining the desired behavior

•Communicating across the company

•Zero tolerance for behavior violations

Getting clear on priorities

•The ‘top five’ per person

•Red, yellow, green

•Complete alignment to the plan

Previous work

on employee engagement

• NAHR presentation

• Recognition, reward programs, training,

compensation, empowerment

• In spite of all previous efforts, global

employee engagement is near an all-time low

• Focus on what the organization can do to

engage you – not what you can do to engage

yourself – JFK in reverse

• The two flight attendants

Daily Question Process

• Why the process works

• How the process works

• Applications on employee

engagement

Active questions vs.

passive questions

you can do to make a positive

difference for yourself and the world

• How passive questions focus on

what the world needs to do to make

a positive difference for you

The hardest daily question

you can ask yourself

• You write the question.

• You know the answer.

• You believe that it is very important.

• All you have to do to get a high score is

try!

Six active questions

Did I do my best to:

• Set clear goals?

• Make progress toward goal

achievement?

• Find meaning?

• Be happy?

• Build positive relationships?

• Be fully engaged?

That boring meeting!

Imagine that you were going to be tested on:

Did I do my best to:

• Be happy?

• Find meaning?

• Build positive relationships?

• Be fully engaged?

What would you do differently?
