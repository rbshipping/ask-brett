The Key Components

© Prepare

Set an aggressive goal

¢ Improve your BATNA

¢ Establish a reservation price

Create a scoring system

Carefully analyze the other side’s BATNA

¢ Negotiate at the package level

@ Make the first offer and build a rationale

Leave yourself room to concede

¢ Make multiple equivalent offers simultaneously

Generating the Issues

# Remember that we do not want to have single

issue negotiations

@ Multiple issues allow us to trade off on the

differences in preferences between the two

sides

Generate the issues by considering your goals

for the interaction

After creating a list of issues, try to fractionate

the issues down to smaller issues

Expanding Your Footprint

There are four issues to add to the deal when

you want to expand your footprint with a

customer. These are the issues to use to

achieve growth in an account:

Exclusivity

¢ Volume Discounts

@ Access

Up Front Payment

Volume Discounts

Create a step function

Never discount on the promise of volume

Only discount on the delivery of volume

You want the customer to achieve the first step

so they receive the first incentive

Take the volume discount beyond the goal for

the account

¢ Use the volume discount to spark conversation

about other products your company could

provide

What Objectives Do You Have?

¢ What are the right issues to be negotiating

at UpDown?

© Remember that no two deals are likely to

look the same because our objectives differ

from situation to situation

Improve Your BATNA

Your BATNA is your greatest source of

power in any negotiation

Improve your BATNA before you negotiate

Engage in simultaneous BATNA

development not sequential BATNA

development

BATNA Analysis at UpDown

¢ What was your BATNA?

Preparation Toolbox:

Develop a Scoring System

¢ The goal is to quantify all issues — generally in terms

of dollars

¢ Define issues — remember these may change once you

meet with the other side

Fractionate larger issues into smaller ones

¢ Prioritize issues

Assign relative weights

® Check for indifference between outcomes with the same

dollar value

@ Make sure your scoring system is dynamic not static

Use scoring system to determine reservation price

Analyze the Other Side’s

BATNA

¢ One of the biggest mistakes negotiators make is to fail to

analyze the other side’s BATNA

¢ This error leads negotiators to negotiate largely in the range

around their own reservation price rather than capitalizing on

the full bargaining zone

¢ You need to carefully analyze the other side’s BATNA

¢ Remember that the other side’s BATNA is not based on a single

issue (i.e., the price a competitor will offer them) ~ it needs to

be analyzed across all of the issues (what are the switching

costs, how confident are they that the other side can deliver,

what is the risk, what are the coordination costs, etc.)

¢ Analyze the BATNA of both sides

Remember that neither side’s BATNA is static.

Each side’s BATNA is dynamic and will

change over time. Consider how each side’s

BATNA will change — will the other side have

greater options or fewer options in the future?

® You want to have long term contracts if the

other side’s options will improve over time.

You want to have short term contracts if the

other side’s options will reduce over time.

Power Analysis at UpDown

How were each of the parties’ BATNAs

going to change over time?

¢ How should this have impacted each parties

preferences regarding the length of the

agreement and opportunities for

renegotiation?

Bundling Negotiations

¢ Sometimes you will find that there are

multiple negotiations going on with the

other side (i.e., when you are selling

multiple products to a particular customer)

You should definitely bundle negotiations

when you have more leverage in one

negotiation than you do in another one —

when the other side’s BATNA is weaker in

one negotiation than in another one

Those Who Speak First —

WIN

Make the first offer to get an anchoring effect

e People make estimates by starting from an initial

anchor value and adjusting from there to yield a

final answer - however, they generally do not make

sufficient adjustments.

e “Anchors are usually based on whatever

information, relevant or irrelevant, is available”

¢ Make the first offer to define the “fair’’

territory

Kellogg

Seed ef Manage

Leave Yourself Room to

Concede

People do not like to make unilateral

concessions

¢ People do not like to make more concessions

than the other side

¢ People like to watch you concede — they

perceive that this means they are “winning”

Present a rationale for every concession

Concessions made before you speak to the

client do not count

Highlight your concessions

Advantages of Making Multiple

Offers Simultaneously

Anchor the negotiation

¢ Collect information from the other side

¢ Allows you to be aggressive — signal cooperation through

the fact that you are offering multiple options

Gather information about the other side’s relative

priorities

Test what the other side is telling you

¢ Allows you to be more persistent

ie

# Make “concessions” that do not cost you anything

¢ Highlight your own value-add

MESQOs as Information

Collection Tools

¢ Often we want to gather information that the other

side does not want to provide

# MESOs are an indirect information collection tool

@ MESOs can help us to uncover information at a

much more granular level

¢ The key is not to determine what the other side

wants. It is to uncover what it is worth to the

other side to get what they want. MESOs help to

uncover this value information.

Detecting Lies

Sometimes the other side may misrepresent

information, overpromise, or outwardly lie

¢ Contingent contracts can be used to assess

whether the other side is overpromising

¢ If the other side is not willing to bet on it,
