Detecting Lies

Sometimes the other side may misrepresent

information, overpromise, or outwardly lie

¢ Contingent contracts can be used to assess

whether the other side is overpromising

¢ If the other side is not willing to bet on it,

you have to consider that perhaps they do

not believe it

Advantages of

Contingent Contracts

Allow negotiators to build on differences, rather

than arguing about them

¢ Allow negotiators to manage their decision

making biases

Allow negotiators to solve problems of trust

Allow trust to be built without confrontation

Great lie-detection device

¢ Allows parties’ incentives to be mutually aligned

Structural Features of

Successful Contingent

Contracts

Require continued interaction between parties

Require enforceability

Require clarity and measurability

¢ Bet on things that are clear, measurable, and

known by both sides

¢ Explicit contingencies create less conflict later

than more implicit agreements

Beware of Overconfidence

¢ In structuring a contingent contract, beware

of our tendency to be overconfident

We do not want to bet with overconfident

estimates or we will pay the price for our

overconfidence

Check your estimates

Need to gather data from those who are

closest to the situation
