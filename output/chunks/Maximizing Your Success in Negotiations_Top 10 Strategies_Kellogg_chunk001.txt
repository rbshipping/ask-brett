(“Wind”) is for sale

@ Both parties are COOs

@ You have authority to sign a

deal today if you can get a

good price

@ Deal must be all cash

¢ No other terms may be added

Prepare

Getting Prepared

Ensure that there are multiple issues on the table

¢ Develop a script

¢ Reduce egocentrism

° Consider the multiple rounds of the discussion

° Avoid traps in the conversation

e Direct the conversation

¢ Analyze Goal, BATNA, and Reservation Price for

both sides

Generating the Issues

Remember that we do not want to have single

issue negotiations

Multiple issues allow us to trade off on the

differences in preferences between the two

sides

Generate the issues by considering your goals

for the interaction

After creating a list of issues, try to fractionate

the issues down to smaller issues

Remember ...

¢ Your RP is not your

aspiration (target)

® Your RP is determined

by your BATNA

Constantly try to

improve your BATNA

Distributive vs Integrative

Negotiations

¢ Distributive ¢ Integrative

* Involves only one issue ° Involves multiple

° Opportunity for

most “strictly enlarging the pie

opposing interests”

° Can increase the

benefits available to

each side by

“capitalizing on

differences in the

parties’ preferences.”

e Win / Lose situation

¢ Always involves

a distributive component

Preparation Toolbox:

Develop a Scoring System

The goal is to quantify all issues — generally in terms

of dollars

Define issues —- remember these may change once

you meet with the other side

® Fractionate larger issues into smaller ones

¢ Prioritize issues

® Assign relative weights

@ Check for indifference between outcomes with the

same dollar value

@ Make sure your scoring system is dynamic not static

¢ Use scoring system to determine reservation price

reservation price — that |

is, the zone of possible

agreement.

Power Analysis

¢ Analyze the BATNA of both sides

¢ Remember that neither side’s BATNA is

static. Each side’s BATNA is dynamic and

will change over time. Consider how each

side’s BATNA will change — will the other

side have greater options or fewer options in

the future?

° Negotiate issue-by-issue?

° Negotiate the entire package?

Those Who Speak First — WIN

@ Make the first offer to get an anchoring

effect

° People make estimates by starting from an

initial anchor value and adjusting from there to

yield a final answer - however, they generally

do not make sufficient adjustments.

e “Anchors are usually based on whatever

information, relevant or irrelevant, is available”

@ Make the first offer to define the “‘fair’’

territory

The Right Rationale

¢ Your offer needs to have a rationale that is focused on the

other side— not on yourself. It is not about your costs or

your needs.

¢ Your rationale should focus on the other side’s interests,

not on rights or power. Make sure your rationale focuses

on the future not on the past.

¢ You should ensure that your offer is framed correctly —

remember that people are risk averse in the domain of

gains and risk seeking in the domain of losses. If you want

someone to change from the status quo and do something

differently, you have to make them risk seeking so you

need to highlight losses not gains.
