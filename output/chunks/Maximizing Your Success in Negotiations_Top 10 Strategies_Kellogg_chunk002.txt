gains and risk seeking in the domain of losses. If you want

someone to change from the status quo and do something

Harnessing Biases as

Influence Tools

Framing is a bias that often impedes the quality of

our decisions yet it can be leveraged as an

influence tool

If we understand the biases that impact people

when they are making decisions, we can leverage

these biases to influence others decisions

¢ In negotiations, consider using framing, the

availability bias, confirmation seeking and

escalation of commitment to your advantage

The Tools of Influence

¢ Availability Bias — people overestimate the

likelihood and frequency of events that easily

come to mind

¢ Confirmation Seeking — people seek confirming

information and often overlook or discount

disconfirming information

Escalation of Commitment — individuals make

decisions based on the decisions they have already

made rather than updating with new information

Leveraging These Tools

¢ Availability — have people tell stories to

create saliency; people will then

overestimate the likelihood and frequency

of these events

Confirmation Seeking — support rationale

with information that confirms the other

side’s beliefs

¢ Escalation of Commitment — highlight how

much has already been spent and how much

time has been invested

“Ten Components of a Strong Deal

Prepare

Set an aggressive goal

¢ Improve your BATNA

¢ Establish a reservation price

¢ Create a scoring system

¢ Carefully analyze the other side’s BATNA

Negotiate at the package level

Make the first offer and build a rationale

Leave Yourself Room to

Concede

People do not like to make unilateral

concessions

¢ People do not like to make more

concessions than the other side

¢ People like to watch you concede — they

perceive that this means they are “winning”

¢ Present a rationale for every concession

Concessions made before you speak to the

client do not count
