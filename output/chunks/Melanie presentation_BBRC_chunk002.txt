[Presentation Topic: Omni-Channel Retail Trends]

C&C baskets tend to be 25% higher than home delivery and in both cases the average basket is above the minimum

Minimum spend - to or not too?

[Slide 14]

Same Day demand has decreased with only 23% of customer willing to pay for this service.

Delivery cost remains one  of the biggest reasons for cart abandonment!

Free shipping is the biggest driver to online sales with Customers willing to wait a few days if they can receive it free. Most retailers offer free shipping over a minimum threshold

Free shipping is also key reason for significant growth in C&C

Other factors to improving customer experience:

Clear, accurate tracking online.

Informative, proactive communication (text, phone or email updates). SMS notifications can be great for this.

Good levels of communication when problems (inevitably) occur. Even the best online retailers will experience delivery issues now and then

Free shipping is more important than same day

Personalisation

Australia has experienced the fastest growth in mobile/tablet use in E-commerce (second only to China)

Tablet and Mobile penetration is roughly equal

Mobile/Tablet traffic is now greater than PC, however Conversion is lower on mobile/tablet

Customers are more likely to utilise Mobile when they are out shopping (ie product research)

17

Mobile first: The most disruptive shift has been from desktop to mobile

Customers experience should be the same across all platforms (e.g Nordstroms)

Responsive sites  have better experience and is easier to manage with only one site required

[Slide 18]

18

Customers are looking for personalised content and have higher affinity for brands that speak to their “wants and needs”

Personalisation leads to greater engagement and ultimately site conversion

Emails with personalized subject lines have 26% percent higher unique open rates

74% of online consumers get frustrated with websites when content (e.g. offers, ads, promotions) appears that has nothing to do with their interests.

[Slide 21]

Personalised Promos and Category content are other ways to boost conversion

Home Page optimisation ensures relevant promotions  being shown to each shopper at each stage of the retail experience

Provides a mechanism to target new customers from repeat customers

Category page optimisation ranks products that the shopper will most likely buy ie by favourite brand, product type etc

[Slide 22]

Younger customers especially are influenced by consumer reviews

Before ever entering a store, 62% of Millennial shoppers already know what they want to buy through prior online research

Eighty-four percent of them say consumer-written content on brand sites influences what they buy.

Mobile shoppers who view customer content like reviews show 133% higher conversion rate

“They contacted me in less than 48 hours and have gone above and beyond to fix my issue,” the customer wrote afterward. “In a world that has become numbers and letters on a screen, at least one business really does care.”

Positive Outcomes can be achieved from Negative Reviews

[Slide 23]

23

Connecting the customer via Social Media is driving higher conversion

Instagram usage continues to grow, while Facebook and Twitter have started to decline

Social conversion rate is just ahead of email, SEM and nearly 3x higher than search and direct

[Slide 24]

facebook

Despite having greater number of “fans”,  it is much harder for brands to get visibility without an advertising budget

Photo posts now have the least organic reach on Facebook

Best performing sites create engaging content that fosters interaction and community ie it is not all about Product:

XXXX Beer - XXXX island

Fitbit - feel like you are part of a fitness support group

Aerie - real beauty and connecting with their fans

Fan pages such as Kmart Hacks, Aldi Mums

[Slide 25]

25

Instagram is the one of the fastest growing sites due to its lifestyle appeal

It’s all about engaging with the community, presenting products in fun and interesting ways, and offering a collection of images and posts that appeal to the lifestyle of your end-user

[Slide 26]

26

Instagram’s users are more willing to engage with brands than other Social Media platforms

Instagram page KmartAus Inspire has more than 67,000 followers and created a community around its brand

A 'Kmart Hack' is the latest in interior design ie changes a Kmart product to suit your home's style

68 percent of Instagram users engage with brands, compared to 32 percent of Facebook’s users who do the same.

Instagram also has 58x more engagement per follower than Facebook

[Slide 27]

27

To show off its new Spring collection, Banana Republic used Instagram’s carousel ads to show off four different looks.

Instagram’s visual and fashion orientated appeal makes it an ideal platform to shop on

Instagram is now offering users the ability to click directly through to a product, creating instant gratification

[Slide 28]

28

Smaller fan base however very engaged

Site should be Pinterest -ready

Boards should create community

Similarly to other Social Media sites, boards should reflect brand’s ethos to create community

Lorna Jane has over 60 boards and mixes product with links, to “content curation” – ie boards with content from other sites of interest to their fans – from inspirational quotes, self-belief, food/health tips to shareable “work out” and movement/fitness workouts
