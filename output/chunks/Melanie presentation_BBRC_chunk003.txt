Instagram is now offering users the ability to click directly through to a product, creating instant gratification

Smaller fan base however very engaged

Site should be Pinterest -ready

Boards should create community

Similarly to other Social Media sites, boards should reflect brand’s ethos to create community

Lorna Jane has over 60 boards and mixes product with links, to “content curation” – ie boards with content from other sites of interest to their fans – from inspirational quotes, self-belief, food/health tips to shareable “work out” and movement/fitness workouts

[Slide 29]

Don’t just post your product marketing images. You may need to relook your marketing budget or better still take images like you expect your customers to take them

Social Media is reflective of your brand personality and should foster collaboration and engagement ie be yourself!

Interact with BRAND LOVERS not influencers - someone might have a lot of connections, but if that don’t love your product like you do then they may not be meaningful to your customers

BE CONSISTENT across all Social Channels and use branded hashtags to connect and share consumer provided content

1- 2 page checkout process

Checkout and how to avoid abandonment (pre-checkout)

There are a number of factors that lead to customers abandoning baskets at checkout

Measuring abandonment at each level of the checkout funnel will help to begin to understand root cause

Keeping checkout as simple as possible

[Slide 35]

Getting the customer back to purchase

SEO tagging and retargeting advertising to remind customers to return to checkout

Retargeting emails works best on customers that expressed high level of intent to buy ie got most of way through

The Iconic, Ebay, Shopbop, Banana Republic and Net-a-porter utilise this in Social Media (Facebook) and other popular sites (Dailymail etc)

Works on “Mere-exposure theory”

Harder to convert and don’t want to be seen bombarding customers

Works well if you want to send an offer (second email)
