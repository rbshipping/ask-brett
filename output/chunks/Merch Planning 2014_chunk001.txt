The bra business is unique

Size range is unique

Requires different disciplines

Longer life

Wide customer base

Has a unique cost versus benefit threshold

Must be a focus

Merchandise planning

Operational excellence

Data integrity

One SKU, one store, one sale at a time

Then repeat in multiple stores

One in one out

Keep it simple

[Slide 5]

Formula versus outcome driven

4

Issue we have to focus on: outcome driven as opposed to formula driven

See example on following slide

Sweet spot between efficiency and effectiveness

Being outcome driven means having stock

In the right store

In the right quantities

...and at the right time

Notes for slide 6 and 7

Deep dive

Allocations by grade – sense check

Where do we have zero stock?

What is our % in stock?

Sales by store

Look at A stores and online vs D grade

Look at each grading

What ratio is it selling at/what ratio did we order it in?

What lessons and adjustments?

Sizes should we discontinue/add

Have we reordered?  Should we reorder?

Ongoing

95% in stock at location by SKU

Min Max online must be A+ on its own

Pick some random on orders and work through methodology

Methodology

Trending - up and down

Whole style vs stepped approach - by size and store gradings

Add or delete sizes

Timing/frequency

Sign offs/ approvals
