Replenishment

?

[Slide 35]

Rules, Tips and Tricks

[Slide 36]

35

Best sellers must have lower weeks cover

Ongoing styles need to run tighter cover

If we're not getting lower weeks cover on best sellers we're not forecasting properly

Stock smoothing (transfers/reallocations)

Rules, Tips and Tricks

[Slide 37]

On Fashion

Your first order is your best order:

repeats quite often fail

36

[Slide 38]

Never, never, never stop replenishing basics (ongoing):

37

Overspend

Freeze on all orders

No OTB

Basics are demand driven

Replenishment considerations are:

Sales rate

Lead time

Product cycle

Being in stock

[Slide 39]

All new products are seasonal and one off, until sales and customers say otherwise

38

[Slide 40]

There is not  ‘a one size fits all’ methodology for order forecasting, or replenishment

39

[Slide 41]

DC cover “buffer” is a flawed process - it is actually the ‘we screwed up’ cover

40

[Slide 42]

Address unacceptable MOQs – smaller orders more frequent

41

[Slide 43]

Rules, Tips and Tricks

42

Holding fabric, raw materials or forward order commitments almost always ends in tears

[Slide 44]

Don't think of an "all stores" and

"all product“ approach - one

at a time!

43

[Slide 45]

Stores

Go visit stores – with a plan

44

[Slide 46]

Fast, Flat and Flexible Structure

45

[Slide 47]

Less is more

It’s too easy to fall into the trap of more and more product

Depth and width of ranging - we tend to go too wide and too deep

Less is more

- in allocations 	- in ranging

- in order quantities

A golden rule - ”one in, one out”

[Slide 48]

Less is more

We work our store space hard

High stock intensity (width and depth)

‘Less is more’

How do these work together?

47

[Slide 49]

Why we mostly have too much stock and rarely, too little

Afraid to give something up

Hang on to the last

If we put in more options, we sell more

Never range or range extend to fill space or fixtures

[Slide 50]

Our Methodology

Pull system versus push system

Pull gives the best results for us with few exceptions

[Slide 51]

Margin Management

It’s not the first margin that matters, it’s the final margin
