[Presentation Topic: Merchandise Planning]

Less is more

We work our store space hard

High stock intensity (width and depth)

‘Less is more’

How do these work together?

47

[Slide 49]

Why we mostly have too much stock and rarely, too little

Afraid to give something up

Hang on to the last

If we put in more options, we sell more

Never range or range extend to fill space or fixtures

[Slide 50]

Our Methodology

Pull system versus push system

Pull gives the best results for us with few exceptions

[Slide 51]

Margin Management

It’s not the first margin that matters, it’s the final margin

There is no secret formula on margin policy

50

[Slide 52]

Open to Buy

51

Why we have Open to Buy:

It tells us exactly how much we are allowed to spend on product each month

Is the key control to prevent us from being overstocked or understocked

It’s a blunt instrument that forces communication between merchandise planners, buyers, finance and the CEO

[Slide 53]

Open To Buy

What is your role (merch  planner) in open to buy?

Forecasting customer demand

Forecasting replenishment of basics (ongoing)

Make sure there is a %$ for when we find a gold-vein or a ‘must have’

Based on data, challenge the product team

52

[Slide 54]

Open to Buy

53

Has failed on too many occasions

Blunt instrument

OTB is set around current trend % positive or negative  (not budget)

CEO sign off/CFO audits

1% over trend is acceptable

GM forecast secondary to sales, GM mustn’t be driver in OTB, Sales is the primary metric

Need to determine ideal stock holdings (build up and decreases) by month fluctuations prior and post Christmas etc

Ongoing doesn’t have an OTB – it has a demand requirement (sales rate and lead time) – demand driven

[Slide 55]

What is Data Integrity?

54

Data integrity is about how accurately the physical product in our stores is reflected in our system

Physical quantity of items versus system quantity

Physical price of item versus system price

Getting data integrity right is critical to sales

Overstocks (mark downs)

Missed sales

Also important because future decisions/forecasts are based on historic sales data – if this data is wrong, we can end up making wrong decisions

Fraud

[Slide 56]

What is Data Integrity?

55

Data Integrity is everything  - You have to be paranoid  - If you see a negative stock on hand, action MUST   be taken

Tending the garden - keep cleaning it up

We need to be part of the solution - issues are inevitable, it’s ongoing, correct it and stay positive

Everything must go through the system - No paper - No workarounds

Keep a tally/records

Product hierarchy and descriptions need to be accurate

Our data is to be perfect

[Slide 57]

Sale and Markdown

[Slide 58]

Sale and markdown

Clearing our product and quantity mistakes

It is never an exact science but we can always do better

Your first markdown is the best markdown

The numbers never lie

- No emotion

- A dog is a dog

Weeks cover drives your markdown, nothing else

- Margin does not

- Hopes and wishes do not

- Price pointing does not

Once a week

Use similar data from previous sales to determine what will happen – proactive learning not reactive – but don’t over think it!
