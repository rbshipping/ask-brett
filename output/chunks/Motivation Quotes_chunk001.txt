MOTIVATON QUOTES

[Slide 2]

IT DOESN’T MATTER WHERE WE START,

WHAT MATTERS IS WHERE WE FINISH

AND THAT WE GET STARTED.

DON’T DIVERT ME…

I AM ON A MISSION.

[Slide 3]

TOO MUCH SUCCESS IS BARELY ENOUGH.

“IN LIFE WE ALL GET KNOCKED DOWN. THE WINNER GETS UP. THE LOSER STAYS DOWN. WHILE YOU KEEP GETTING UP YOU ARE NEVER DEFEATED.”

[Slide 4]

YOU NEED TO FIRST HAVE SOMETHING WORTH DOING BEFORE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT BETTER.

ENTREPRENEURS ARE SIMPLY THOSE WHO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS LITTLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OBSTACLE AND OPPORTUNITY, AND ARE ABLE TO TURN BOTH TO THEIR ADVANTAGE.

~NICCOLO MACHIAVELLI

[Slide 5]

FAILURE IS OK – RISK TO KEEP IT “REAL”.

RISK CAN BE TAKEN EVEN MUST BE TAKEN TO KEEP IT “REAL”.

IF YOU FAIL, NEVER GIVE UP

BECAUSE F.A.I.L. MEANS “FIRST ATTEMPT IN LEARNING”.

END IS NOT THE END. IN FACT E.N.D. MEANS “EFFORT NEVER DIES”.

IF YOU GET NO AS AN ANSWER, REMEMBER N.O. MEANS “NEXT OPPORTUNITY”.

SO LET’S BE POSITIVE!
