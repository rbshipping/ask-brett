Fly by the seat of your pants

Make it up as you go along

‘Our desks/offices are next to each other’

All will

let you down

[Slide 43]

Tips and things you must do:

Must have rhythm

1 hour maximum

Write up objectives as you go

You write the objective and agree to the who and when (almost always the direct report, although delegation is appropriate and normal)

Admin support team can and should be utilized if appropriate

ASAP- a ‘no, no’

Ongoing – allowed but not ideal

In yours and the brand’s success

Who supports who?

[Slide 80]

Is the support centre managing you or are you managing it

Is the business managing you or are you managing it

[Slide 81]

‘Our role is to remove the impediments that stop our stores from being able to do a good job’

The support centre regularly forgets this

Why is this the case?

[Slide 82]

They tell us what is actually happening not what we hope/think is happening

Again, if we can’t measure it, we can’t improve it

<number>

[Slide 90]

What we never do well enough?

Celebrate, acknowledge  and reward the good stuff

Measure the next results against your expected results

Take Action
