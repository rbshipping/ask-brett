Customer Complaints

Are you aware that it is policy for all CEOs to take the initial call when we receive customer complaint?

A customer does us a huge favour by making a complaint

don’t get defensive

fix the customer issue immediately.

We take the customers side ‘perception is the reality’

address the business issue - the individual, the process, the procedure

Remember - ‘it’s about the customer,   always’!

[Slide 95]

Customer Complaint Reports

Eliminate the reasons why we say no to a customer and how we empower our teams to do whatever it takes to please the customer.

The Future

[Slide 119]

It is never about what you’re doing – it is about what you’re doing for the customer!

[Slide 120]

The Customer

Courtesy

Understand

Smile

Talk

Offer a greeting

Make it easy for the customer. Be positive

Enjoy what you are doing and  it will show

Remember the customer is:

The most important person in the store

King and the reason for our existence, they pay us each week

Rule number  1: the customer is always right

Rule number 2: if the customer is wrong, refer to rule number 1

It’s about the customer always

[Slide 121]

To succeed, we must be passionate about the customer and put the customer first, always!

[Slide 122]

Good customer focus must be created, educated and repeated.

We must get into a rhythm..

We must support and remind   each other…

[Slide 123]

We truly only have one boss – the customer!

The relationship with your boss must be taken very, very seriously.

[Slide 124]

Refunds

Our store team need to be educated, trained and empowered to exchange, refund or credit any product sold by us no matter what condition it is in and no matter what the reason is, with a smile and a “how can we help” attitude.

[Slide 125]

“Can I Help You?” Is Not Customer Service!

[Slide 126]

Customer service –

not lip service

[Slide 127]

The point is that we must concentrate our energy on satisfying every single customer, every single day and every single time they enter our store(s).

Be obsessed about perfect service…

[Slide 128]

In every discussion and every meeting, ask “how will this affect our customer?”
