A 1hr negotiation/meeting = 1hr of preparation

Develop your script

Prepare answers for their objections in advanced

Be crystal clear on your goal for the meeting…i.e. introduce yourself, build the relationship & trust, present your offer or close the deal.

Preparation = confidence!

Find all the facts…  about the business & the individual

Are you dealing with the decision maker?

1. More preparation

[Slide 9]

2. Establish your reservation price

Know your reservation or walk away price before you start negotiating

Often this is your budget or forecast

Be prepared to actually finish negotiating or withdraw once you go below your “reservation price”

9

[Slide 10]

Create an ambitious but not outrageous goal price or offer

Not offensive!

Build your rationale to justify your price

Leave enough wiggle room between your reservation price and the goal – build the relationship and shows flexibility

People love seeing you concede!

3. Set an aggressive goal andleave yourself room to concede

4. Know their alternative!

Analyse the other parties best alternative options if they don’t reach agreement with you

A real source of power in negotiation

When preparing, focus on the weakness of the other parties alternatives!

Also be clear on your own alternatives if you don’t agree on the deal…

[Slide 12]

5. Always in person

Never negotiate on email

“If you can say it… don’t send it!”

In person best, if not, on phone…

Ok to email confirmation of your discussion afterwards

Accelerate deals, improves relationships and you can read body language, mirror and observe reactions to your offer

Our future is held in the right hemisphere of our brain

[Slide 13]

“Those who speak first, win!”

Make the first offer to “anchor” the price and lead the conversation

Relationship enhancing vs damaging

If they do go first, don’t ask them questions about it, ignore it and go back to your offer

Practice pre-framing to ensure no surprises!

6. Make the first offer!

7. Focus on their needs!

Identify what is their #1 pressing need before the negotiation?

Take the time to get to know them, what matters to them, build the relationship vs rush to close the deal

Be a pronoun checker – no “I” or “we”, its all “you” or “your company”

It’s not about you!

14

[Slide 15]

8. LISTENING AS A MARTIAL ART

Basic human need is to be heard and understood – an essential life skill

Listening is cheapest and most effective concession to fulfil this need!

Active listening vs passive listening

Become an “expert in empathy”!

Ask an open ended questions – how, what & why?

Eyes peeled, ears open and mouth shut! Stop thinking about what you’re going to say next

Practice mirroring - summarise back key 2-3 words

Slow down – be a “people mover” vs a problem solver

Be a “detective” and have a mindset of discovery

Power of the pause!

15

[Slide 16]

Present 2-3 offers you are willing to commit to

3 offers = a discussion  vs  1 offer = a presentation

Shows you are flexible, adaptable and improves your relationship

Allows you to gather info about what is important to them and test what they have been telling you

9. Present multiple offers

Option 3: Remain in 70% of space, pay passing rent & we take back 1,500sqm & re-lease it.

Domayne Kotara negotiation

[Slide 19]

Focus on the entire package vs issue by issue

Use verb of “could” vs “will” – keep options open vs committing

Use words like “big picture, related, depending on or linked”

“Nothing is settled until everything is agreed”

Be clear if this is a one-off (stand alone) vs an ongoing series of deals (risk and opportunity of a precedent deal)

No deal is better than a bad deal!

10.  Negotiate at package level

[Slide 20]

+1. EVERY “NO” GETS YOU CLOSER TO A “YES”

“F word” (fair) is the most powerful word in negotiation!
