Domayne Kotara negotiation

[Slide 19]

Focus on the entire package vs issue by issue

Use verb of “could” vs “will” – keep options open vs committing

Use words like “big picture, related, depending on or linked”

“Nothing is settled until everything is agreed”

Be clear if this is a one-off (stand alone) vs an ongoing series of deals (risk and opportunity of a precedent deal)

No deal is better than a bad deal!

10.  Negotiate at package level

+1. EVERY “NO” GETS YOU CLOSER TO A “YES”

“F word” (fair) is the most powerful word in negotiation!

Early in negotiation you can say “I want you to feel like you are being treated fairly at all times, so please stop me at anytime if you feel I’m being unfair and we’ll address it.”

Beware of “yes” as there are 3 types:

Counterfeit – easy escape, avoiding confrontation

Confirmation – reflect response, affirmation with no action

Commitment – the real deal, leads to action!

If your biggest fear is “no” you can’t negotiate. “No” ≠ rejection… so let go of your baggage around this word!

“No” is the start of the negotiation, not the end of it. It could mean:

“I’m not ready to agree yet, I don’t understand, I need more info, etc”

“No” allows real issues to come up, helps others feel safe and in control and slows things down…
