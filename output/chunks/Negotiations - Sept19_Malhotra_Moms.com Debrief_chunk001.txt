The Negotiator’s Challenge

Creating AND Capturing Value

- Need to work together to create value

- Need to compete in order to capture your share

[Slide 3]

Value Creation Strategy #1Trade across issues

[Slide 4]

How we destroy value…

Not enough effort/desire to learn about their interests

Not sharing (or misrepresenting) your own interests

Negotiating 1 issue at a time

Setting arbitrary “reservation values” on individual issues, rather than on the whole deal

Not wanting them to get everything they want on a single issue. (Too narrow a perspective on what it means to “win”.)

[Slide 5]

Value Creation Strategy #2Add issues that create value for either side

Creates additional value.

Also gives you more ways to deal with deadlock.

[Slide 6]

Objective:Reach a Value Maximizing Agreement

One of your goals in every negotiation should be to maximize value creation.

“no party can be made better off without making another party worse off.”

This is not the same as “win-win”…

[Slide 7]

The Problem of Conflicting Beliefs

Different Expectations of Future Events

Different Beliefs about the True Value of Asset

Potential Solutions:

Agree to disagree –set this issue aside and try to hammer out a deal.

One of you convinces the other

You decide to “meet half-way” –maybe both parties are slightly wrong.

Get a 3rd party (analyst/expert/mediator) to decide who is correct.

OR…..

[Slide 8]

Value Creation Strategy #3Use Contingency Contracts

[Slide 9]

The Benefits of Contingency Contracts

Contingency contracts allow negotiators to…

Diagnose the other side’s honesty & solve problems of trust.

Leverage differences. Don’t argue over the future. Bet on it.

Hedge, by sharing in potential upside (or potential downside).

Align incentives and motivate appropriate behavior.

[Slide 10]

Caveats on Contingency Contracts

Is your contingency based on parameters that are objectively measurable?

Are their information asymmetries that give the other side an advantage in structuring the contingency?

Are the contingencies incentive compatible?

Will making outcomes contingent on performing X “crowd out” performance of Y?

[Slide 12]

Value Creation!

A great idea… but how do we get there in practice?

[Slide 13]

How to Begin?

Which issue should you negotiate first?

The hardest?

The easiest?

The one that affects your bottom line most?

The one that you can compromise on easily?

[Slide 14]

Some Keys to Creating Value

Add issues.

Negotiate multiple issues simultaneously.

Look for differences in priorities and valuations.

Make trades.

Information exchange is critical…

But information exchange is not always easy!

[Slide 15]

Eliciting Information to Create Value

Identify your Assumptions

Ask Questions & Triangulate on the Truth

Give Away Some Information First

Negotiate Multiple Issues Simultaneously

Make Multiple Offers Simultaneously

Search for Post-Settlement Settlements

[Slide 16]

Creating Value in Negotiation

Focus on what you don’t know…have a learning mindset. Ask questions!

Explore all the ways in which they can create value for you.

Explore all the ways in which you can create value for them.

Find out: what they value; what their priorities are; what keeps them up at night; why they are sitting with you; what they really wish their partners understood…

Be willing to start the information exchange process…this also helps you control the frame. But get buy-in on process (“I will start, and you will follow… okay?”).

Multi-issue negotiations allow for value creation… don’t just haggle on each issue.

Negotiate multiple issues simultaneously.

Trade across issues: give what they value more in exchange for what you value more.

Add issues that provide additional opportunities for value creating exchange.

Use contingency contracts to (a) diagnose their honesty, (b) create value by overcoming real differences of opinion regarding future events, (c) hedge and (d) align incentives.

Make multiple offers simultaneously to (a) find out what they really value, (b) anchor more effectively, and (c) signal flexibility and a willingness to learn.

Consider doing a Post-Settlement Settlements…or schedule one for the near future.
