[Slide 5]

Fly by the seat of your pants

Make it up as you go along

‘I call them when I need to’

‘We talk all the time’

‘Our desks/offices are next to each other’

All will

let you down

[Slide 6]

Tips and things you must do:

Must have rhythm

1 hour max

Write up objectives as you go

You or your EA write the objective and agree the who and when (almost always the direct report, although delegation is appropriate and normal)

Admin support team can and should be utilized if appropriate

ASAP- a ‘no, no’

Ongoing – allowed but not ideal
