Why

How

[Slide 4]

“In a company with over 300,000 employees and 4,000 senior managers, we need more than just touchy-feely good intentions. There has to be a structure and logic so that every employee knows the rules of the games.”

Jack Welch

[Slide 5]

Did We Stack Up?

As managers we are responsible for:

Maximising profit results

Producing sales

Minimising markdowns, shrinkage & expenses

Producing maximum productivity from our team

At the end of every month, we ask ourselves…

Did our numbers stack up?  Were we successful?

[Slide 6]

Jack Welch

“There weren’t enough hours in a day or a year to spend on people. This meant everything to me. I’d always try to remind managers at every level that they had to share my passion. While I might be the “big shot” standing in front of them today, they were in fact the “big shots” to the people in their businesses.”

[Slide 16]

The Meetings

Getting the most from your PAR’s

[Slide 17]

PEOPLE ASSET REVIEW

People asset review meetings

Short, informal, trusting meeting with line manager to discuss each report

Meeting length approx 30min

Opportunities: 1on1, admin day, over the phone

Discussion time mostly spent on:

Each reports development needs

Whether opportunities can be improved upon

HiPo and PIP action

Be proactive – book the meetings in advance

[Slide 18]

Jack Welch

“No matter what we put in our books… What counts is the passion and intensity everyone brings to the table.

When managers put their necks on the line for their direct reports, you learn as much about them as the people you’re discussing.”

[Slide 19]

PEOPLE ASSET REVIEW

What does the info show?

Demonstrates if a manager:

Is focused on people first

Has the ability to give and receive open and feedback

Has an understanding of every individual

Is driving business growth through leadership

[Slide 20]

PEOPLE ASSET REVIEW

Providing feedback to team being reviewed

Not meant to be an appraisal

Do not need to meet with direct reports to discuss process or evaluations

Open and honest conversations with team member

If asked… answer with caution:

Provide ongoing & constructive feedback

[Slide 21]

Common mistake

1...

Scoring On The Line

[Slide 22]

Scoring On The Line

Score within the 9-space grid

[Slide 23]

Scoring On The Line

Do not score on the line… no “sitting on the fence” evaluating

9-space becomes overcomplicated (more than 80 solutions)

[Slide 24]

Common mistake

2...

Non-specific highlight points

[Slide 25]

Non-Specific Highlight Points

Points must be objective and specific

All 4 highlight points must be filled in – 2 for potential and 2 for performance

There must be at least one development point written (they can’t be all strengths) because we all have room for improvement

[Slide 26]

Non-Specific Highlight Points

Based only on the last 4 weeks of performance

Make notes over the month, and then simply transfer this information onto the PAR form

Don’t wait for the end of the month to try and remember back

[Slide 27]

Non-Specific Highlight Points

The highlight points should be specific enough, that if you looked back on a review 12months later you could remember the situation

It doesn’t have to be an essay, but simply putting an example  on the end of a statement that helps you explain the behaviour

Points should be objective that is factual

[Slide 28]

Highlight points examples

[Slide 29]

Common mistake

3...

Not rating fairly

[Slide 30]

Not Rating Fairly

It is critical that when completing ratings you objectively review the team members performance and potential

Watch out for these common rating errors:

The Halo (they are so good they never do anything wrong) or Devil (they are so bad they never do anything right) effect

Leniency (you score everyone easy) or Strictness (you score everyone hard) tendency

Average tendency (you score everyone in the middle)
