Not rating fairly

[Slide 30]

Not Rating Fairly

It is critical that when completing ratings you objectively review the team members performance and potential

Watch out for these common rating errors:

The Halo (they are so good they never do anything wrong) or Devil (they are so bad they never do anything right) effect

Leniency (you score everyone easy) or Strictness (you score everyone hard) tendency

Average tendency (you score everyone in the middle)

Mistakes Managers Make

[Slide 32]

Mistakes Managers Make

Spending more time on filling in form, than ongoing performance communication and coaching

Forgetting that the evaluation is about improvement, not blame or focusing on the negative

Not holding team accountable for results

Not understanding the difference between potential and performance

Not enough questioning in PAR meetings on a monthly basis line managers… why, why, why?

[Slide 33]

Common mistake

4...

Not doing anything with the information

[Slide 34]

Not Doing Anything With The Info

People Asset Reviews are simply the process of:

Filling out the forms, and

Discussing the results with your manager

However, once you have completed a PAR, you should then complete a coaching plan for the TM, so you can concentrate on building on their strengths and improving on their areas of opportunity

The Up and Coming HiPo’s

Development plans

Encourage & stretch by setting goals towards making it on the LDP program

[Slide 44]

The PIP’s

[Slide 45]

Jack Welch

“Identifying the A’s is one of the treats of managing. Everyone enjoys doing that.

Developing and rewarding the valuable keeps in the middle 70 percent poses little difficulty.

Dealing with the bottom 10 is tougher.”

[Slide 46]

The PIP’S

PIPs 5%

Problem Child

[Slide 47]

Jack Welch

“Some think it’s cruel or brutal to remove the bottom 10 percent of our people. It isn’t. It’s just the opposite. What I think is brutal and “false kindness” is keeping people around who aren’t going to grow and prosper. There’s no cruelty like waiting and telling people late in their careers that they don’t belong.”

[Slide 48]

PEOPLE ASSET REVIEW

PIP Action

[Slide 49]

Jack Welch

“Removing people will always be the hardest decision a leader faces. Anyone who ‘enjoys doing it’ shouldn’t be on the payroll, and neither should anyone who can’t do it”.

Jack Welch

“They had to identify the people in their organizations that they consider in the top 20 percent, the vital middle 70, and finally the bottom 10 percent.

“We eventually found one we really liked. We called it the vitality curve.”
