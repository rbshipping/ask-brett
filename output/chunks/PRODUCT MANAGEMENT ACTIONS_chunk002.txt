wherever possible once we have arrived at our final stock position we will ask our managers to get

to work and re-merchandise our stores ready to go for the opening. This will help keep our managers

remain engaged and earning an income and rather than 10 team doing 4 hours each to set up and

process our markdowns and flip our store to sale we will have our manager and potentially our full

times come in and ‘re-set’ the store.

When do we start buying?

Our intention once we have decided on what we want our offer to be post sale, our buyers that have

either developed products already or are in the process of developing products for July onwards are

to develop and bring these lines to final sign off and have then agreed and quantified. HOWEVER no

lines are to be purchased until we see the CV cases in decline and in simple terms ‘can see the light

at the end of the tunnel’. We are fortunate that we can turn around lines with a 6 weeks

turnaround, so once we open and start trading we will use this initial period to clear old lines and

excess product.
