Introduction

How Strategy Really Works

T

his is a book about strategy, written by a former CEO and a

business school dean. When we met, we were neither of those

things. More than twenty years ago, when we first worked together

on a study of P&G’s distribution channels, it was as a category

manager in P&G’s laundry business and an outside consultant

from a small but growing strategy firm called Monitor Company.

Working on that assignment, we formed the basis of a very produc-

tive and very long friendship. By the time we became, respectively,

CEO of P&G and dean of the Rotman School of Management,

we were true thinking partners on strategy and worked together

in earnest on the transformation of P&G between 2000 and 2009.

This book is the story of that transformation and the approach to

strategy that informed it. (Details on the results of the transforma-

tion may be found in appendix A.)

This approach grew out of the strategy practice at Moni-

tor Company and subsequently became the standard process at

P&G. Over the course of our careers, we worked to develop a

robust framework around our strategic approach, a way to teach

the concepts to others, and a methodology for bringing it to life

in an organization. Within Monitor, Michael Porter, Mark Fuller,

Sandi Pocharski, and Jonathan Goodman played important roles

in advancing this thinking. At P&G, Tom Laco, Steve Donovan,

Clayt Daley, Gil Cloyd, and dozens of other business and func-

tional leaders (including those whose stories are told in this book)

all contributed substantially to the work of sharpening the strat-

egy of the company. Along with Michael Porter, academics Peter

Drucker and Chris Argyris were seminal influences who shaped

our thinking and work.

Ultimately, this is a story about choices, including the choice to

create a discipline of strategic thinking and strategic practice within

an organization. Though we use P&G as our main example, this

doesn’t mean that our approach to strategy can only be effective in

a global consumer goods company. We’ve seen it powerfully used

in all manner of industries and all sizes of organizations, including

start-ups, not-for-profits, and government agencies. But it was at

P&G that we were really able to use this approach across a wide

range of businesses, geographies, and functions and over a decade

(and to see where it worked and didn’t work)—so that is the story

we have chosen to tell. We will use P&G brand, category, sector,

function, and company examples to illustrate the strategy concepts

and tools throughout the book. Of course, not all companies look

like P&G. But it is our hope that through examples from across

P&G’s diverse businesses, organizations, and levels, the lessons for

your organization will become clear.

What Is Strategy?

Strategy is a relatively young discipline. Until the middle of the last

century, much of what people now think of as strategy was catego-

rized simply as management. So it is really no wonder that many

organizations struggle to define what a strategy is and how to cre-

ate a useful one; there is no single, clear, and pervasive definition

of strategy and even less consensus on how to build one. When

a strategy succeeds, it seems a little like magic, unknowable and

unexplainable in advance but obvious in retrospect.

It isn’t. Really, strategy is about making specific choices to win

in the marketplace. According to Mike Porter, author of Competi-

tive Strategy, perhaps the most widely respected book on strategy

ever written, a firm creates a sustainable competitive advantage
