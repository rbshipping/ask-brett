Summing Up

It isn’t entirely easy to make your way through the full choice

cascade. Doing so isn’t a one-way, linear process. There is no check-

list, whereby you create and articulate aspirations, then move on to

where-to-play and how-to-win choices, then consider capabilities.

Rather, strategy is an iterative process in which all of the moving

parts influence one another and must be taken into account together.

A company must understand its existing core capabilities and con-

sider them when deciding where to play and how to win. But it

may need to generate and invest in new core capabilities to sup-

port important, forward-looking where-to-play and how-to-win

Strategy Is Choice 33

choices, too. Considering the dynamic feedback loop between all

five choices, strategy isn’t easy. But it is doable. A clear and power-

ful framework for thinking about choices is a helpful start for man-

agers and other leaders intent on improving the strategy for their

business or function.

Strategy needn’t be the purview of a small set of experts. It can be

demystified into a set of five important questions that can (and should)

be asked at every level of the business: What is your winning aspira-

tion? Where should you play? How can you win there? What capa-

bilities do you need? What management systems would support it all?

These choices, which can be understood as a strategic choice cascade,

can be captured on a single page. They can create a shared understand-

ing of your company’s strategy and what must be done to achieve it.

The essence of each choice and how to think about the choices (sepa-

rately and together) will be the subject of the next five chapters, begin-

ning with the first question: what is the winning aspiration?

ChoiCe CasCade dos and don’ts

At the end of each chapter, we will share a few quick bits of advice—

the things you should do or should avoid doing as you apply the les-

sons of the chapter to your own business.

� Do remember that strategy is about winning choices. It

is a coordinated and integrated set of five very specific

choices. As you define your strategy, choose what you will

do and what you will not do.

� Do make your way through all five choices. Don’t stop

after defining winning, after choosing where to play and

how to win, or even after assessing your capabilities. All

five questions must be answered if you are to create a

viable, actionable, and sustainable strategy.

� Do think of strategy as an iterative process; as you

uncover insights at one stage in the cascade, you may

well need to revisit choices elsewhere in the cascade.

� Do understand that strategy happens at multiple levels in

the organization. An organization can be thought of as a

set of nested cascades. Keep the other cascades in mind

while working on yours.

� Do remember that there is no one perfect strategy; find

the distinctive choices that work for you.

Chapter Two

What Is Winning

A

spirations are the guiding purpose of an enterprise. Think

of the Starbucks mission statement: “To inspire and nurture

the human spirit—one person, one cup, and one neighborhood

at a time.” Or Nike’s: “To bring inspiration and innovation to

every athlete* in the world.” (The additional note, indicated by

the asterisk, reads: “*If you have a body, you’re an athlete.”) And

McDonald’s: “Be our customers’ favorite place and way to eat.”

Each is a statement of what the company seeks to be and a reflec-

tion of its reason to exist. But a lofty mission isn’t a strategy. It is

merely a starting point.

The first box in the strategic choice cascade—what is our win-

ning aspiration?—defines the purpose of your enterprise, its guid-

ing mission and aspiration, in strategic terms. What does winning

look like for this organization? What, specifically, is its strategic

aspiration? These answers are the foundation of your discussion

of strategy; they set the context for all the strategic choices that

follow.

There are many ways the higher-order aspiration of a com-

pany can be expressed. As a rule of thumb, though, start with peo-

ple (consumers and customers) rather than money (stock price).
