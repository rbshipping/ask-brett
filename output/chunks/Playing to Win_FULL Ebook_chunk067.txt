Reservations are important and must be taken into consideration,

but only in the form of conditions that would have to be true (and

not as explicit criticism of the validity of the possibility).

It is important that every individual’s conditions are given equal

consideration, to ensure that no one fails to engage, out of fear or

embarrassment. But it is equally important that options are reverse

engineered by the group, not the individual who first suggested the

possibility. There is no ownership of possibilities by individuals,

lest the process derail. To help separate individuals from ideas, you

could have an outside facilitator to guide the team through the pro-

cess, drawing out contributions from quieter voices and attempt-

ing to capture all possibilities. Having at least one person in the

room with an investment in the process but no strong view about

the outcome can be extremely helpful. The reverse-engineering

chart for Olay would look something like the one in figure 8-4,

with conditions spanning all seven boxes.

194 Playing to Win

Under industry analysis, to proceed with building a masstige

segment for Olay, there would have to be a large segment of women

who care about multiple signs of aging, and these women would

have to respond to a compelling brand and product offering on this

front. The new masstige segment would have to be at least as struc-

turally attractive as Oil of Olay’s existing mass segment in terms of

buyer power, supplier power, threat of new entrants, s ubstitutes,

and competitive rivalry.

In terms of the customer value analysis, the mass channel

would have to embrace the masstige concept and be willing to

work with P&G to create the kind of in-store experience that

would support the new segment and reinforce the Olay brand. On

the consumer side, P&G would have to be able to find a winning

price that would attract both mass and prestige consumers. To

work, masstige offerings would need to trade up mass consumers

to more-expensive products and drive prestige shoppers to

purchase in a new channel.

On analysis of relative position, a number of conditions related

to capabilities in product development, retail partnerships, and

brand building would have to be true. In the cost box, P&G would

have to be able to create a prestige-like, superior product at a cost

that would enable a pricing structure just below the prestige brands.

Finally, what would have to be true about the competitive

reaction? Prestige competitors, bound tightly to their preferred

and well-known channels, would have to refrain from shifting to

the mass channel. Also, mass competitors would have to be inca-

pable of credibly creating competitive products from a technol-

ogy and branding point of view, because of the importance of low

prices to their positioning and the limits of their capabilities relative

to P&G’s.

Once a full set of conditions is articulated, the list can be pared

back by the group. To do so, ask about each condition: if all the

other conditions were found to hold but this one didn’t, would

that eliminate this possibility? This helps distinguish between the

nice-to-have conditions and the must-have conditions. Typically

during the generation of conditions, a number of the former are

mixed in with the latter. One condition might be, for instance,

that retailers would have to be able to earn higher margins on this
