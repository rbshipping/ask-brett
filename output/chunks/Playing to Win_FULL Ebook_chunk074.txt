can be complex and winding; you will need to circle back, revisit,

and revise. But taken together (see figure C-1), the playbook can

guide your strategic thinking and help create true and lasting com-

petitive advantage.

Six Strategy Traps

There is no perfect strategy—no algorithm that can guarantee

sustainable competitive advantage in a given industry or business.

But there are signals that a company has a particularly worrisome

strategy. Here are six of the most common strategy traps:

1. The do-it-all strategy: failing to make choices, and making

everything a priority. Remember, strategy is choice.

2. The Don Quixote strategy: attacking competitive “walled

cities” or taking on the strongest competitor first, head-

to-head. Remember, where to play is your choice. Pick

somewhere you can have a chance to win.

3. The Waterloo strategy: starting wars on multiple fronts

with multiple competitors at the same time. No company

can do everything well. If you try to do so, you will do

everything weakly.

4. The something-for-everyone strategy: attempting to

capture all consumer or channel or geographic or category

segments at once. Remember, to create real value, you

have to choose to serve some constituents really well and

not worry about the others.

5. The dreams-that-never-come-true strategy: developing high-

level aspirations and mission statements that never get trans-

lated into concrete where-to-play and how-to-win choices,

core capabilities, and management systems. R emember that

aspirations are not strategy. Strategy is the answer to all five

questions in the choice cascade.

6. The program-of-the-month strategy: settling for generic

industry strategies, in which all competitors are chasing

the same customers, geographies, and segments in the

same way. The choice cascade and activity system that

supports these choices should be distinctive. The more

your choices look like those of your competitors, the less

likely you will ever win.

These are strategic traps to be aware of as you craft a strategy

for your organization. But there are also signs that you have found

a winning and defensible strategy. Let’s look at these next.

Six Telltale Signs of a Winning Strategy

Because the world is so complex, it is hard to tell definitely which

results are due to the strategy, which to macro factors, and which

to luck. But, there are some common signs that a winning strategy

is in place. Look for these, for your own business and among your

competitors.

1. An activity system that looks different from any competi-

tor’s system. It means you are attempting to deliver value

in a distinctive way.

2. Customers who absolutely adore you, and noncustomers

who can’t see why anybody would buy from you. This

means you have been choiceful.

3. Competitors who make a good profit doing what they are

doing. It means your strategy has left where-to-play and

how-to-win choices for competitors, who don’t need to

attack the heart of your market to survive.

4. More resources to spend on an ongoing basis than

competitors have. This means you are winning the value

equation and have the biggest margin between price

and costs and the best capacity to add spending to take

advantage of an opportunity or defend your turf.

5. Competitors who attack one another, not you. It means

that you look like the hardest target in the (broadly

defined) industry to attack.

6. Customers who look first to you for innovations, new

products, and service enhancement to make their lives

better. This means that your customers believe that you

are uniquely positioned to create value for them.

Even companies with these telltale signs shouldn’t rest, because

no strategy lasts forever. All companies need to evolve their

strategies—to improve, sharpen, and change to stay competitive

and, ultimately, to win year after year. Ideally, companies should

see strategy as a process rather than a result—adapting existing

choices before business and financial results (which are always

lagging indicators) start to turn down.

All strategy entails risk. But operating in a slow-growing, fast-
