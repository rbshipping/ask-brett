tions to whatever success we were able to achieve together.

I cut my teeth on strategy in what was then called the U.S. Pack-

aged Soap and Detergent Division at P&G, one of the company’s big-

gest, oldest, and most profitable businesses. At one time or another in

my first eleven years at the company, I worked on every category and

brand in the division. Working in a mature, slow-growing, highly

competitive industry, I learned how to d ifferentiate and distinguish

a business, how to create competitive advantage, and how to gener-

ate meaningful value—because if we didn’t, we’d go out of business.

Steve Donovan, a P&G-er I worked for and with during fifteen years

of my career, set the standard high for strategy, for execution, and for

value creation. And he always focused on playing to win.

I was fortunate to be a part of the first Applied Strategic

Management training at P&G in the late 1980s—to learn from

Michael Porter and to work with Mark Fuller and Roger Martin.

It was a privilege to work with Peter Drucker from 2000 until

his death in 2005 and to collaborate with him on the unique work

of the CEO, which, of course, starts with strategy.

In the time I served as Chairman and CEO, P&G tried to build

a network of strategic partnerships with customers, suppliers,

other business partners, and even competitors (in noncompetitive

industries). As P&G expanded across geographies and industries,

we tried to encourage an ongoing strategic dialogue in all of the

different businesses. In the course of the decade, I learned so much

from my colleagues—particularly from:

• Gil Cloyd, former P&G Chief Innovation Officer, who

shared my belief that P&G could and should change its

strategy toward innovation;

• Clayt Daley, former P&G Chief Financial Officer, who

helped me sort through industries and businesses for struc-

tural and strategic attractiveness, and P&G businesses for

competitive edge; and

• P&G business and functional presidents and P&G category,

country, and customer general managers (too numerous to

name individually) who dialogued, discussed, and debated

their where-to-play and how-to-win choices. I’m sure I

drove more than a few of them crazy, pushing them to make

the clearer and often harder choices required to win.

Neither Playing to Win nor my previous book The Game

Changer would have happened without the caring commitment

and counsel of my wife, Diana. She is my best coach and my clear-

est and most constructive critic. She encourages me to translate my

personal experiences and learning into simple concepts and insights

that logically lead to practical actions for others to follow. That is

what Roger and I have sought to do in this book.

Appendix A

P&G’s Performance

T

he stories in this book are taken from the years 2000 to 2009.

Over those years, P&G sales doubled and profits quadrupled.

Earnings per share increased 12 percent per year. P&G’s share

price increased by more than 80 percent in a decade that saw the

S&P 500 go down overall. Company market capitalization more

than doubled, placing P&G among the most valuable companies

in the world. The company was able to deliver significantly more

value, create competitive advantage, and perform at a consistently

high level over the decade.

While these facts capture something about the performance

of the company over the decade, they do not directly answer

these questions: did the strategic choices deliver winning results?

And if so, which specific choices delivered which business and

financial results? These answers are captured in tables A-1 and

A-2, which illustrate the specific business and financial contribu-

tions of the where-to-play and how-to-win choices made in the

period.
