choose (per Playing to Win). I would offer a different perspective. All the

integrative thinkers that I chronicled in The Opposable Mind, from Bob

Young of Red Hat to Isadore Sharp of Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts

to Victoria Hale of the Institute for One World Health to A.G. Lafley,

made many key choices. In fact, all made clear and distinctive choices

about where to play and how to win. The difference between these lead-

ers and their competitors is not in the act of choosing, but rather in the

standards they apply to the choice. Integrative thinkers set a high bar

for where to play and how to win. They assess existing options or busi-

ness models against that high bar, and when no existing model offers a

reasonable probability of winning, integrative thinkers refuse resolutely

to choose between those existing alternatives. In my view, there is no

inconsistency between integrative thinking and strategy choice making.

Integrative thinkers set a high bar to make strategy choices that really

pay off for their organizations.

Chapter One

1. To keep things as simple as possible, we have tried to

consistently use the same terminology throughout the book. Because

these terms may not be universally defined in the same way, we will

specify what we mean in a few cases. For our purposes, consumers are

end users—the people who buy P&G’s products and take them home

for themselves and their families. Customers, on the other hand, are

retailers—the stores that serve as channels or middlemen between P&G

and consumers. P&G sells to customers, who sell to consumers.

11. Porter uses activity systems to capture the strategy of a business

unit. In his conception, the largest nodes are the key strategic themes—

the elements of the strategy that set the firm apart and create competitive

advantage. The links between them represent important reinforcing rela-

tionships. The subordinate nodes in the map are the supporting activities,

the tightly linked systems that support and enhance the functioning of the

core themes. In our adaptation of Porter’s activity systems, we consider

the largest hubs the core capabilities rather than strategic themes, the

themes having already been captured in the answers to where to play and

how to win.
