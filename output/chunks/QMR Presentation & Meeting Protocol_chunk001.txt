[Presentation Topic: Meeting Protocol]

[Slide 1]

Each CEO will be required to take 10 minutes to present the good and bad that is occurring within their brand that they feel the rest of the group would benefit from knowing

Ensure all the points you raise are relevant for the group to know and don’t get bogged in unnecessary detail, excuses or bragging..

Text on slides to be kept to a minimum – you should speak to each point rather than reading direct from the screen.

You have 10 minutes to present.  You must adhere to this time as the time will be kept.  Don’t be offended if you are cut off, we must remember that this is an information sharing meeting only. (if you need more time, request it in advance)

No Interruptions during presentation! Keep a note of clarifications needed and any questions you may wish to ask until the ends of the presentation.   There will be 5 minutes allocated for question and answer.
