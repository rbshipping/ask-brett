Eggs

• We almost were stuck with a sleeve

of cement on 2400 units.

• On last sample looked at packaging

only and didn't crack open to test

product. Had looked at the three

previous. Assumed the same.

Ladyrider

• Wash tested, wear tested but did

not zip test on larger back. Branded

windows, marketing sites and built

excitement around launch.

• Zip busted on every corset and

recalled and sent back to Antex.

Stuck with windows.

Shop fit

• China bulk joinery quality bad.

Maintenance issue. Rushed to make

timelines and quality suffered as a result.

Handover

• Taking handover over sites without given

final approval from Property. Could have

cost us a week which we needed.

Returns process

• Going from a owner operator business

protective of $$ to competing with returns

process on national retailers.

Couldn’t get 30% of the pucks in

on handover day.

Stock

• Inexperience in merch planning.

• We didn’t anticipate new lines to sell so quickly.

• Reordered more leading to a lack of variety.

• Knew we didn’t have the right skills on board.

• Trying to do it on the cheap.

• Resulted in too many changes leading to revised

ex-factory dates.

Marketing

• Using the same model over again due to $$

• Got too generic

The Good, The Bad and the Ugly

Presented by Chris Yates

“The business opportunity to

manage labour from a different

perspective”

The Current Reality

1. Labour cost as a perc entage of sales is under

significant pressure.

2. The rate per hour m odel is comprised by the

casual labour element.

3. Trade profiles are not embedded in rosters.

4. Store visits at peak trade periods highlight

teams under pressure to "style“, close the

business and deliver the brand execution that

we are renowned for.

The Learning

1. We could invest at $200 per hour and begin to

close the gap in sales target performance and

labour cost %.

2. The data required to conduct a "labour match" is

available e.g. trade % splits by day, and trade per

trading hour.

3. The top 30 stores account for up to 33% of

company turnover and present a controllable

subset in which to manage, measure and review

performance.

The Bad

The Current Reality

1. The operational team have not recognised the

large space trade under performance .

2. Generic decisions hav e been applied to the large

stores without logical c hallenge and consideration

for the consequences.

3. 12 out of the top 30 stores trade significantly

below the company average on Saturday and

Saturday is not the biggest single trading day for

50% of the top 30 stores.

4. Not spending all the allocated hours is seen as a

green KPI.

The Learning

1. Trials at 2 large stores in the Top 30 on

Saturday the 11th with the regional managers

supporting the stores at peak to "style" and

close the presented business increased

turnover significantly week on week.

2. Having had a success, it woke up people to

the potential. Bourke St lift was over 50% day

on day growth week 44 to week 45.

3. If regional management worked to a

prescribed formula we could have greater

wins.

The Ugly

The Current Reality

1. By Thursday if trade hasn't been strong and

productivity is under pressure, hours are cut

from the weekend rosters.

2. This creates the potential for a detrimental

effect on the teams ability to sell.

3. The Friday, Saturday and Sunday trade

accounts for 51 % whilst we have

underperformance on these days how much

bigger could it be?

4. Casual hours represent 28% of hours used in

week 44 but cost 25% more, therefore the

rate per hour model is being compromised

and further pressure on labour cost will

reduce hours in store.

The Learning

1. Plan weekends!

2. Understand the impact of pulling the hours

lever in isolation of turnover target.

3. Over manning at the early part of the week

actually predetermines the productivity

outcome.

4. Project manage the labour planning challenge

at the highest level.

5. Coach all levels of management on the

effective management of labour.
