Sportsgirl stores.

 Sportsgirl confirmed they have been presented with opportunity to acquire Supre. Comment was ...”its not going to

happen, its a laugh”.

 Sussans closing in NZ. Dunedin, St Lukes, Sylvia Park, North City & Shore City. All other store re-badge to Suzzane

Grae

 Group only doing 1 & 2 year deals. 5 years only with rent caps. No New Stores.

original agreed stores now going back to landlords.
