Plan

Plan

1. Within 4 weeks start the Top 30 labour matching.

2. Coach and train all regio nal and state managers how

to :

- measure hours and trade profiles.

- manage rate per hour.

- review schedules to invest @ $200 per hour at

peak times to grow sales.

Measure

1. Measure through the data available cut the

weekly trade profiles over the last 12 weeks

for the Top 30.

2 . Measure the effectiveness of all

field management rosters and schedule 12

weeks in advance.

3. Measure the invested hours and sales uplifts

achieved to create a sense of belief and trust

that we are doing the right things.

Review

1. Once we are confident that Saturday has

been successfully implemented, repeat the

process on the Top 30 stores for Thursday

and Friday peak trade periods.

2. Establish a weekly labour review project

within the Operations team chaired by the

Head of Operations with the CEO and CFO

as attendees.

Future

1. Structure labour t asks in-store to prescribed

time deadlines.

2. Move the productivity threshold higher as

confidence in the process grows.

The life of our fixtures, fittings and fit-outs

An early lesson that I learned is that fashion is not the priority in fit-

outs. Longevity and the fact that they will last 5 years vs it looks terrific at

opening, goes out of fashion, gets dirty, scruffy. No matter what we think

,we will not spend the money half way through the fit-out or spend money

dry cleaning curtains, floors, changing carpets, let alone having the

expertise, resource or skill to know that it is happening.

• Longevity

• Fashion over form

• Five years

• We never do what we think we do

• It’s always too expensive

• Ensure longevity is first priority

Pricing Scanners
