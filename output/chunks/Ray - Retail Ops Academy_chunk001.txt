Make sure everyone has enough to do

Do our people really want to be there

Challenge yourself to think outside the box

Power of everyone working towards a common goal

[Slide 7]

Our time in stores

It is more than just going from store to store

Are we making time to develop our State and Area Managers?

Getting to the root cause of the problem

Really looking under the hood

Being in stores is the most important part of our role

[Slide 8]

Your time

[Slide 9]

Managing Emails

The more you send the more you will get back

Only send to who needs it and drive the same for you

Unregister from all junk email or reports you don’t use

Make sure you proof read your emails before you send them

Be careful what time you send emails out and the message you send

[Slide 10]

Phone Calls

Do you phone your best performers and congratulate?

Do you phone the worst performing team and ask them what you can do to help?

Have a sense of urgency returning phone calls

If you’re leaving a message to call you back, let them know when your not available to avoid phone tag

[Slide 11]

Objective Meetings

This is your most important tool

Don’t let being busy stop you from doing them, this is when they are needed the most

We are recognising and acknowledging issues, problems and inefficiencies – a tool to effective permanent solutions.

Turn talk, thinking and discussions into actions and outcomes that will stick.

[Slide 12]

Managing Business Objectives?

Your Planner

Be in control of the business… don’t let the business needs drive you to change your planner

Do you have a yearly retail planner?

You must always be a month ahead of everyone to succeed

[Slide 14]

Our Customer…

[Slide 15]

Our Customer

Do we really make sure that everything we do is for THEM?

Ownership of the customer service offer and the need for continuous improvement has to be driven from the top of the organisation

Measure from a customer’s perspective to get a true understanding of the retail customer experience

Were are we at and what should we be doing differently?

[Slide 18]

Results

[Slide 19]

Results

What are the numbers telling you?

Why??

Knowing your results is the first step to improvement.  If you don't measure it, you don't know if what you're doing is getting better or worse.

Results take a lot of the emotion out of decision making… with numbers, decisions can be based more on facts rather than feelings and personal preferences.

Do you know your EBIT for all your stores?

Study the numbers before you spend time with your team

What is being done about them?

[Slide 21]

Accountability

What is it really?

How do we hold our team accountable?

1:1 discussions & formal discussions

People

[Slide 23]

Recruitment

Do your team know who we are looking for?

What is it we actually want?

Do they fit our Company Culture?

[Slide 24]

Buyer Beware

Second opinions… there is no such thing as too many interviews!

As people managers we are trained to look for the good in people

It is very easy to become blinded by someone’s energy or raw ambition

The more senior the role, the more right you have to be the first time, getting it wrong will be too costly

Don’t be afraid to get them in front of someone else to double check your thoughts on an individual

If in doubt keep digging, don’t take a punt

For a technical role put them in front of someone technical

Job Description

The purpose of the Job Description:

To ensure that we are hiring the right people to fill the right positions.

If a Job Description is well written:

A communication tools that allow our Team to clearly understand the expectations of the role

Understand the essential duties, the competencies & responsibilities

You want to make sure that– as an organisation–you have set forward what you hold people accountable for (not just the work).

[Slide 30]

KPI’s

Having KPIs gives you the information you need to manage your Team

Individual KPIs will tell your team members what they must focus on if they are to succeed.

This will allow them to concentrate on the important and not just the urgent.

Knowing what they must do to succeed in their jobs, and knowing how well they are performing will give your team members confidence and make work easy and more fun.

Make sure they are the right KPI’s

[Slide 32]

Training

How much is too much too little?

Are our tools current?

Is it documented?

What are our follow up methods?

Ask the Team in stores about their training…

Making it stick!!

Change is, at its core, a people process

People are creatures of habit, hardwired to resist adopting new mind-sets, practices, and behaviours.

To achieve and sustain transformational change “Making it Stick”. Brands must…

Embed these mind-sets, practices, and behaviours at every level

It is very hard to do — but it has never been more important

[Slide 35]

How do we make it stick?
