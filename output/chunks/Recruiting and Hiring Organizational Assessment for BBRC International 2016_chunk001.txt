Applying Best Practices

A Comprehensive Model

Most companies react to recruiting and hiring as emergencies and lack even a model of best

practice. In addition, executives often have widely differing views about:

* Desirable attributes of new hires

© Whether it is best to hire insiders or outsiders

* Who should be involved in the recruiting process

« What assessment tools work best

* What are the keys to successful hiring and retention

In order to be effective, recruiting and hiring must be approached from a rigorous, strategic, and

objective point of view. It should be a process--not a mish mash of disjoint and ad hoc activity.

We have developed a comprehensive end-to-end set of best practices* to recruit and hire the

best talent that employs the following 7-step process:

Organizations should review their leadership requirements, at the very least, every two to three

years and develop a plan that can answer the following questions:

* What does our organizational structure need to look like in the next few years to support

our strategic objectives?

° How many people will we need and in what positions to fulfill this structure and, thereby,

meet our objectives?

* What qualities are we looking for in those people, and how will we know when we find

them?

2 What does our pipeline need to contain today to ensure that we can find, develop, and

support the leaders of tomorrow?

Companies must define the particular job skills they need, and recruit and judge candidates

accordingly. We have developed a systematic way to consider the full range of skills that a job

would require, called the “Portfolio Model of Human Capital.”** Our research suggests that hiring

is greatly improved if companies use the following template of the model's basic tenets:

Job-based competencies

* What specific capabilities will this job require over the next few years?

* If this is a stretch opportunity, can the candidate grow into the job?

* What are the next jobs he or she is likely to move into, and what capabilities may be

required for those positions?

Team-based competencies

* Does the candidate have the skills to lead his or her prospective team?

° How do they overlap with other members’ skills?

* Will the individual need to hire additional people to build out the team? If so, can he or

she bring in other talented executives?

Firm-based competencies
