* If this is a stretch opportunity, can the candidate grow into the job?

* What are the next jobs he or she is likely to move into, and what capabilities may be

required for those positions?

Team-based competencies

* Does the candidate have the skills to lead his or her prospective team?

° How do they overlap with other members’ skills?

* Will the individual need to hire additional people to build out the team? If so, can he or

she bring in other talented executives?

Firm-based competencies

* How well does the candidate fit into the organizational culture?

* Will this person flourish with the resources (supporting talent, technology, organizational

reputation, and so on) the organization can provide?

* If the person comes from a more resource-rich environment, can equivalent support be

provided, or at least can the candidate be helped to adapt to less?

in general, companies consider too few candidates for a position and limit the reach of the

candidate pool. In order to increase the likelihood of finding the right person for the job,

companies must cast a wide net. Many firms will include both insider and outsider candidates in

the pool but the following categories should also be included:

* “Inside outsiders” internal candidates who are nevertheless not bound by corporate

tradition and ideology and so may have a more objective view of the organization.

* “Outside-insider” that is, a former employee; a customer, supplier, or adviser to the firm;

or someone who has worked closely with a trusted insider.

To increase reach of pool, companies should aiso strategically tap their networks. The most

effective strategy for sourcing is to think not only about candidates themselves but also about

people who may know the best ones. Talk to individuals who are likely to suggest several high-

quality candidates right off the bat. The best leads will come from suppliers, customers, board

members, and professional service providers.

How do you know when to stop looking for candidates? It has been demonstrated empirically

that the simple decision rule of “meeting a dozen” works weil, even when you are sampling

candidates from a very large population. Once you have 10 to 12 carefully generated, high-

quality candidates, you should move to the next step.

A good assessment yields more than a good candidate — it can actually improve the company’s

bottom line and market value in a very significant way. What is usually called the “assessment

process’ is in reality three separate practices, with three different objectives. One goal is to

evaluate the candidates. A second is to sell the position and the organization to highly attractive

candidates, especially those who may be wary. A third is to build organizational consensus on

the suitability of the new candidate, particularly if he or she is external. Each of these objectives

can conilict with the other two. An assessment process that will effectively execute on all three

uses the following sequence of steps:

¢ The right interviewers: The first step is to select a small number of individuals —

typically the hire’s prospective boss, the boss’s boss, and the top HR manager — to

conduct the interviews and check references. It is more important to choose the right

assessors than to focus on the assessment technique.

The right number of interviewers: Given the importance and difficulty of assessments,

you may be tempted to involve a large number of interviewers. Probabilistic analysis
