general, organizations that systematically integrate new employees enjoy lower turnover, and

the recruits report greater commitment and job satisfaction. An effective integration plan should

consist of the following:

* Begin integrating new hires during the interview stage, before they ever come to work.

* Assign each new employee a mentor. A veteran of the company’s culture can serve as a

valuabie reality check until the newcomer becomes fully culturally literate. Also, the

mentor’s role should be ongoing, not just a quick “buddy” fix to make the newcomer feel

at home.

* Mandate that new leaders formally check in quarterly with their mentors, their bosses,

and HR for the first year or so, no matter how well they’re performing.

* Analyze progress against expectations by asking four basic questions:

~ Is the new hire getting adequate support?

- Is he or she developing the right relationships within the organization?

- Does the new manager understand the business model?

- Is there evidence of progress?

In the absence of regularly scheduled check-ins, a new hire might be reluctant to ask for help,

for fear of losing face. It’s important that bosses, mentors and HR executives be trained to give

feedback and handle difficult conversations appropriately — that is, to be coaches rather than

cheerleaders.

STEP 7: AUDIT AND REVIEW

Great recruiting and integration processes will minimize, but can never eliminate, the chances of

making a hiring mistake. When that happens, best-practice demands quick removal of bad hires

— within the first year. One year may not be enough time for a new executive hire to forge any

great successes — but it’s plenty of time to demonstrate ineptitude.

To improve what might be called your “hiring batting average,” it's important to regularly audit

and review your recruiting practices. Periodic reviews can also help identify those in your

organization who are particularly adept at assessing talent. In fact, rewarding your assessors

(and, conversely, holding them accountable) for the quality of their evaluations will motivate

them to improve next time.
