Retail Operations

Academy

Lets get going…

What is a retail

operations role?

• Retail is and always has been hard and

physical work. If we want to avoid being

crushed by our competition, you need to

out think, out plan, out work and out

execute them… 52 weeks a year.

• That’s an ongoing commitment you have

to make to the strategy and tactics you

have to have to win at retail.

WORK HARD

• Why do we spend more of our time in

stores than not?

– What’s the purpose?

– What’s the tactic?

– What’s the benefit?

BE IN STORES

It’s about

the customer, always!

• “Sorry I can’t sell you

that, we’re

stocktaking”

• “… Because the

customers come in”

• “I felt like I was

intruding in their

space”

CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE

Communicate! Communicate!

Communicate!

Success never happens because we hope or wish it will.

It happens because we decide what should happen, what

needs to change, what our culture needs to be and what

people need to be and then we need to get out and

communicate, communicate, communicate any way that

you can and as frequently as you can in words and in

actions.

STANDARDS AND DISCIPLINES

BB

retail capital

Communicate,

Communicate,

Communicate.

Communication

•

Get everyone

talking

Communicate,

Communicate,

Communicate

Communicate! Communicate!

Communicate!

• Communicate:

– Formally

– Informally

– Speak

– Write

– Video

– Message

– In your every action

Communicate! Communicate!

Communicate!

‘When I’ve told ‘em once, I’ll tells ‘em again

and when I’ve told ‘em again, I’ll tells ‘em

one more time. And when I’ve told ‘em

one more time, I find a way to tell ‘em

again.’

When launching something new or hitting

something hard that has fallen off its

perch - six different times, in six different

ways. Continuous communication

Repetition

• Communication is greatly aided by obsessive

paranoia. Fear that the message isn’t getting

out.

• Communication is greatly assisted by an

enthusiastic delivery.

• Communication is greatly assisted when the

leaders are actioning and participating in

whatever is being communicated.

• Communication is a ‘rhythm thing’ – get into a

rhythm, form the habit whenever you can

• Remember to follow up

• Never under estimate the impact that you,

as leaders, have on your team and always

remember that whatever you’re

communicating has a greater impact than

you think.

• Never utter the words…But I told them..

Weekly Memo

• Value of our weekly memo

– The heart beat

– Sets the pace

– Sets the expectations

– Sets the tone

– Drives our values, who we are , what's

important

The Weekly Memo

• The purpose:

– Communication to the stores

– Once a week – same day, same time every

week

– All activities/instructions to be in that memo

– All actions required to be completed weekly

– Expectation that it gets done

– Follow up is essential

Weekly Memo

• Remember who your audience is

– The lower you go in the organisation, the

more often you have to deliver the message

• Keep it simple

– Flowery/fluffy stuff doesn’t work as well

– Big words don’t work as well

Front Page

• Must be written by the CEO (cover page)

• Inspirational/good news piece

– Reasons behind why we do things - strategy,

process

• Your piece – educational/motivational

Pitfalls

• You are the author

– NRM approval on every single section

• Needs to be in ‘store speak’

• Your timeframe

• Clear instruction

• Nothing can be sent to the stores or any

retail team unless in the weekly memo or

SAM

– This is controversial – let’s discuss

Tips

• Involve state managers

• Get your successor’s involved (i.e. state

manager to write an article or critique your

memo)

• 1/3 communication

• 1/3 education

• 1/3 motivation/inspiration

Tips

• Test

• Memo alone will never get the required

traction

The SAM

• The next level up

– The why’s

– The greater strategies

– Issues of concern

– Weeding the garden

– What’s required/expected

– Where we are going

Store Diary

• Monthly

• Everything that needs

doing:

– Daily

– Weekly

– Monthly

• Think about the new

store manager

Store Diary Tips

• If it isn’t being filled in or used as you

designed it, you either don’t need it or you

have a business issue to manage

• Everything in one place

– Remember our job is to make it easy for the

store team to do their job

Store Diary and Weekly Memo

• Weakest link in the chain

• With the store diary and weekly memo

combined, a first week manager should be

able to do the job

The Missing Link

BB

Management By

Objectives

(One on ones)

Objective Meetings:

• Turn talk and discussions into actions and

outcomes that will stick.

• Professionally acknowledging, recognising,

discussing and informing on issues ,

opportunities and challenges – a tool to

effect permanent solutions and change.

Management By Objectives

• State the objective

• Who is responsible?

• Due date

• Not a to do list

• Not minutes of meetings

• Objectives brought to the meeting

• Discussion

• Value add and support by leader

• Your chance to add objectives

Helps to identify:

• Talkers who don’t do

• Time wasters

• Direct reports in the wrong job

• Disorganisation

• Problems early (management, process,

people)
