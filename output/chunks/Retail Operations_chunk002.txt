Creating A Winning Team

• Passive versus holding your team

accountable for outcomes and timeframes

Leaders have more

impact on their

people than they

think they do

Retail is not difficult…

Just demanding.

Management gets the

team it deserves

A team never outpaces

its leader

People are Human

• Touch your team everyday

• We are all human and need to be

emotionally connected

• Remember to communicate the

positives/wins

People Asset Reviews (PARs)

Discussion

• Demotions or putting team back

– Not adjusting their salary and what appears to

be an easily justified answer

– It will eventually catch up and eat you and the

business.

– Whatever you think, make sure you know that

somewhere down the track, it will cause an

issue

Recruitment

• Qualified recruiters

• Staying on top of vacancies

Salary Adjustments

• Salary adjustments a key indicator

• A lose/lose

The Role of our

Support Centres

In yours and the brand’s success

Who runs who?

Who supports who?

• Is the support centre managing you or are

you managing it

• Is the business managing you or are you

managing it

‘Our role is to remove the impediments that

stop our stores from being able to do a good

job’

The support centre regularly forgets this

Why is this the case?

Exercise

• Break into groups of 3 or 4

• Discuss and determine the number one

frustration you have in your role

– Retail related

– Support centre related

– Not sales

– Not product design

• We will discuss ways to improve and cut

through

Your Role and HR

• HR

• Misunderstood

• Operations are the people managers and must

be expert in the management of our team

• We:

• Promote

• Discipline

• Motivate

• Hire and fire

Team Satisfaction/Mystery

Shopping Reports

87

We agree:

1.Customers are everything!

2.The team are our most important asset

3.We must measure our performance

88

Team surveys and mystery shopping give us

• Moments of truth

• A snap shot that tells us how we are doing

• They tell us what is actually happening not

what we hope/think is happening

Again, if we can’t measure it, we can’t

improve it

89

What we never do well enough?

• Celebrate, acknowledge and reward the good stuff

• Identify areas that need attention, focus or improvement

• Set your plans and actions to bring about positive

improvement

• Share your thoughts with all

• Communicate the results or part thereof and what you

are doing and what is expected

• Measure the next results against your expected results

Take Action

Who comes first our team

or our customers?

• The needs of our customers versus the

needs of our team (people)

• Constant questions that come up

– Do we change?

– What do we change?

– What do we live with?

– Who do we change?

– How do we change?
