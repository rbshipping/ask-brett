Satisfaction

Job satisfaction should be a by-product of

putting the customer first, not the reverse.

Customer Complaints

• Are you aware that it is policy for all CEOs to

take the initial call when we receive customer

complaint?

– A customer does us a huge favour by making a

complaint

– don’t get defensive

– fix the customer issue immediately.

– We take the customers side ‘perception is the reality’

– address the business issue - the individual, the

process, the procedure

Remember - ‘it’s about the customer,

always’!

Customer Complaint Reports

• Eliminate the reasons why we say no to a

customer and how we empower our teams

to do whatever it takes to please the

customer.

emember the customer is:

– The most important person in the store

– King and the reason for our existence, they pay us each week

– Rule number 1: the customer is always right

– Rule number 2: if the customer is wrong, refer to rule number 1

– It’s about the customer always

To succeed, we must be

passionate about the

customer and put the

customer first, always!

Good customer focus must be

created, educated and repeated.

We must get into a rhythm..

We must support and remind

each other…

We truly only have one boss

– the customer!

The relationship with your

boss must be taken very,

very seriously.

Refunds

• Our store team need to be educated,

trained and empowered to exchange,

refund or credit any product sold by

us no matter what condition it is in

and no matter what the reason is,

with a smile and a “how can we help”

attitude.

“Can I Help You?”

Is Not Customer Service!

Customer service –

not lip service

The point is that we must

concentrate our energy on

satisfying every single

customer, every single day

and every single time they

enter our store(s).

Be obsessed about perfect

service…

In every discussion and

every meeting, ask “how

will this affect our

customer?”
