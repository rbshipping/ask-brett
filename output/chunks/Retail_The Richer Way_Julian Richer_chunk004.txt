Why ts it so important?

Cheapest and effective method of advertising

Customer service is a differentiating factor. Service and surroundings important but

service counts more.

Loyalty

Price advantages are often short term

Good service is a “conversion tool’

Prompts impulse buying

Assists in something catching customers eye

Winners provide great value for money ~ quality and price

Quality = professional skills Price & Efficiency

Manufacturing processes Market judgement

Buying team

Every staff member is an ambassador for the organisation. The organisation is judged

on the performance of all teams

Under promise over deliver — fitout average/service excellent, repairs estimated

longer than likely to take

Don't make customer service big marketing pitch

Management must believe in legendary customer service — living it and breathing it

Allocate resources

Motivation affects everything staff do ~ staff must want to do it

Accountability and measurement — what gets measured gets done

Good customer service is when customer thinks so

Customer friendly environment :

Environment should welcome customers — ease of access, décor, layout, staff

greetings, signage — Richer uses sign in window stating come in for directions, browse

around, or shelter from the rain. Everyone is a potential customer.

Real service — adapting and individual, tune into people, listen and respond. Make

customer centre of attention

Service takes training, effort and learning from experience — think of customer at

different stages.

Extensive number of staff procedures — including scripts with flexibility

Prepared by Tim Cash July 2002

Friendly Places

e First impressions re environment last — positive signs, example “free ride in police car

— for shop lifters today only!”
