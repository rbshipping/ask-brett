Performance Grid

The H/H quadrant:

Superstars which deliver both high space and high inventory productivity

The job here is to add both additional space and additional inventory and assortment

The H/L quadrant:

Produces high inventory productivity, but low space productivity

Here we keep or reduce the space and increase the merchandise intensity

Master Matrix Roles and Measurements

[Slide 36]

Performance Grid

The L/H quadrant:

Produces high space productivity, but low inventory productivity

Here we will increase the space while reviewing the merchandise mix

The L/L quadrant:

Produces both low space  and low inventory productivity

Here we are broken and must fix it, reduce the space and reduce the inventory or change the mix, or we must close it

In all cases where one or both components are low, we should also consider a market scoping exercise
