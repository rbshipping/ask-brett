A low % of items drive business (20/20/60 rule)

3.  Category roles

Traffic drivers

GM$ (put money in bank)

Relevance (offer)

Basket analysis

<number>

[Slide 57]

Back to the Top Ten List….

In-stock, in-stock, in-stock

5.  Range reviews almost always bring large benefits.

6.  De-listing can change perception of 	assortment.

7.  You can’t de-list your way to a good GMROI…GMROI is a “fixable” concept.

[Slide 58]

Another Detour….

[Slide 59]

Back to the Top Ten List….

Need a strategy to clear old or excess inventory….

9.	May need multiple assortment strategies under one roof.

10.	Consistent category management gets harder over time.

[Slide 67]

Customer Analysis

Recency

when last shopped

defections

Frequency

how strong is the relationship with store or brand

need to know buying patterns of shoppers

Value

Basket size and profitability

Value to household, not the retailer

[Slide 68]

Customer Analysis

Best customers are worth more than you might think

For nonfood retailers:  Typically, top 10% worth 40+% sales, 50% margin; top 20% worth 75% sales, 80% margin

Half of NM sales from 100,000 shoppers

Do you know who they are?

Fundamentally different question than “target market” or “fashion market segment”

New opportunities to identify (or to define!)

[Slide 69]

Customer Loyalty Programs

[Slide 70]

Loyalty and Brand Programs

Strategy

Why are you doing this?

Building the brand is not enough

Drive traffic?

Drive sales?

Points for what???

Nectar vs. Clubcard

Incremental spend

Smaller retailers need at least 3 of 4

Qualifications

Ex ante or ex post?

Period?

Volume?

Multi-brand?

Multiple channel issues?

[Slide 72]

Lessons from Department Store Programs

Don’t be too complicated

Number of tiers

How to earn

Discount Programs tend to be “cheap”

Gift cards 2.5% to 4% value

0.3% to 0.5% per dollar equivalent on point systems

Goldilocks problem with frequency

Customers tend to value perks rather than discounts

Exclusive offers

“Early” shopping

Free services (alterations, shipping, concierge)

[Slide 73]

Summary

Product Analysis

Transaction Analysis

Customer Performance and Demand

Marrying customer, transaction, and product information

5 Laws of Retail Merchandise/Operations

Stores think buyers are stupid; buyers thinks stores are stupid.

Both buyers and stores like merchandise; both buyers and stores don’t like finance people – who see merchandise as a cost!

Neither buyers nor store operations folks can imagine doing what the other one does day in and day out.

Planograms kinda sorta sometimes work, but they are better than the alternative – which is often “let’s cram it in somewhere” or “spread it out so it looks like we have more”

It takes a while to get serious about merchandise productivity…Growing businesses don’t worry about merchandise, especially if they are opening new stores….but then all that stock picks up speed, whacks you in the back of the head and knocks you down…and more stable businesses “get used to it”…
