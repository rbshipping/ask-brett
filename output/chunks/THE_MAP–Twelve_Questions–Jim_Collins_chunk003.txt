About Jim

Jim Collins is a student and teacher of what makes great companies tick, and a Socratic advisor

to leaders in the business and social sectors. Having invested more than a quarter century in

rigorous research, he has authored or coauthored a series of books that have sold in total more

than 10 million copies worldwide. They include Good to Great, the #1 bestseller, which

examines why some companies make the leap and others don’t; the enduring classic Built to

Last, which discovers why some companies remain visionary for generations; How the Mighty

Fall, which delves into how once-great companies can self-destruct; and Great by Choice, which

uncovers the leadership behaviors for thriving in chaos and uncertainty.

Jim has also published two monographs that extend the ideas in his primary books: Good to

Great and the Social Sectors and Turning the Flywheel.

His most recent publication is BE 2.0 (Beyond Entrepreneurship 2.0), an ambitious upgrade of his very first book; it returns

Jim to his original focus on small, entrepreneurial companies and honors his coauthor and mentor Bill Lazier.

Driven by a relentless curiosity, Jim began his research and teaching career on the faculty at the Stanford Graduate School

of Business, where he received the Distinguished Teaching Award in 1992. In 1995, he founded a management laboratory

in Boulder, Colorado, where he conducts research and engages with CEOs and senior-leadership teams.

In addition to his work in the business sector, Jim has a passion for learning and teaching in the social sectors, including

education, healthcare, government, faith-based organizations, social ventures, and cause-driven nonprofits. In 2012 and

2013, he had the honor to serve a two-year appointment as the Class of 1951 Chair for the Study of Leadership at the

United States Military Academy at West Point.

Jim holds a bachelor's degree in mathematical sciences and an MBA from Stanford University, and honorary doctoral

degrees from the University of Colorado and the Peter F. Drucker Graduate School of Management at Claremont Graduate

University. In 2017, Forbes selected Jim as one of the 100 Greatest Living Business Minds.
