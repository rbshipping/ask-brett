The importance of retail ‘experience’

Cap Gemini Ernst & Young surveyed 6,000 consumers across Europe for their 2002 study.

Their five key findings were:

1. Human values have become the contemporary currency of commerce

2. When it comes to the five attributes of a transaction — price, product, service, access and experience —

consumers and businesses are speaking different languages.

3. The majority of consumers are hard-pressed to identify favourite stores in many retail channels in the

nine countries.

4. Retailers in general are not well differentiated in the minds of consumers in terms of their value

propositions.

5. Demographics make a difference — women were more likely than men to rate factors related to

satisfaction as extremely important, while younger consumers were les apt than older shoppers.
