categorise the store and brand.

patronage intentions.

in store.

problems.

Image determined by physical & psychological attributes.

Store Attraction

Why this store?

Reflective surfaces slow people down — more likely to stop

and look.

Large display at rear of store with sound and movement -

draws people in. Must be congruent with store front.

| feel wanted, not just welcome - and am prepared to pay

more for this privelege.

Signage and window items are large, clear, simple and hold

the “right’ information — let's me know what | will find inside.

Kid friendly — if they aren't welcome, | won't come.

167

Store Attraction — Key Attributes

Distinct identity and good presentation. Will only be

overlooked if customer has psychological relationship with

the store and/or brand.

Congruence between the product lines, the brand values

and the physical environment.

Good lighting — appropriate to the store.

Importance of the whole — design elements must be

congruent and complementary. The store must “make

sense” eg congruence between music and fragrance.

How People Shop

General Principles

e Stores of discretionary spend are seen as a place for:

¢ opportunity for self expression

e fantasy and break from routine

e self indulgence

e Recreation

e being myself

e Shopping is:

e a spectacle in which | am performer and observer

e about seeing/being seen; meeting/being met

e away to interact with people

171 Leo Burnett

When I shop ...

lf the store “makes sense” to me, I’m more likely to go in,

stay longer, be more satisfied and impulse buy.

The longer I’m in the shop, the more likely | am to spend

money.

The more contact | have with staff, | am more likely to spend

more.

The longer | hold an item, the more likely | am to buy it,

even if | didn’t plan to when | came in.

| like to talk with someone about my purchases (especially

women).

Physical Considerations

People don't see or hear in the “transition zone” — the

physical and psychological “space” just inside the store.

You can help the “transit” by starting the store outside —

gives them time to absorb and adjust on approach. Also

builds “visual anticipation”.

You can subvert the transition zone by using “speed bumps”

— large displays that say “look atme”.

People naturally “tum left” when they enter a store.

People tend to “reach right’ when they handle product.

People don't “see” things below the knee or above eye level

People don't see collateral on the way in - more on the way

out.

People don't like to touch a meticulous display.

173

Leo Burnett

Gender — Female Shopping

Shopping is seen predominantly as a female pursuit —

though research has shown this stereotype to be changing.

More “considered” purchasers — tend to browse and engage

for longer periods.

Gravitate towards a “dwell zone” — where they are

comfortable. If not, won't stay or buy.

When with a man, is often the decision maker.

174 Leo Burnett

Gender — Male Shopping

Tend to focus on acquiring the item and transacting.

Like a bargain and bargain hunting.

Enjoy browsing, touching and exploring.

Like to develop “expertise” — derive status from this, gives a

sense of power and control.

More masculine shoppers “shop to win” — but are becoming

increasingly “feminine”.

When with a woman, is less often the decision maker, but

generally is the person reaching for their wallet.

175

Leo Burnett

Gender and Our Category

Men shop according to the technology itself.

Women shop according to it’s usefulness.

Men like to gather information on their own.

Women like to engage and ask questions.

Women tend to require an “extra” visit before they purchase.
