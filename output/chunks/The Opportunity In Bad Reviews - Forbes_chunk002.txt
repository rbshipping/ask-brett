4. Law of Numbers

Overwhelm negative reviews with positive ones. Don’t worry

about optimizing review content for search engines; instead,

focus on getting a high volume of positive reviews so your

overall search results reflect well on your business. The search

engines will do their work if you do yours.

Don’t be tempted to generate positive reviews yourself or pay

others to do so. These are easily seen through by experienced

review­site users, and the revelation that you’ve bought or

written a five­star review yourself can be damaging to your

brand’s credibility.

Many hotels and restaurants remind customers to leave a review

at the end of their stay. Sandbar, a popular restaurant in Santa

Barbara includes a flyer requesting Yelp reviews in each end­of­

meal billfold. While Yelp discourages this, they do recommend

using free Yelp signage to remind customers your online

reputation is important to you.

Reviews overall are critically important to business success, but

any one review shouldn’t keep you up at night. Do what you can

to fix those that can be salvaged, and accept the others as

constructive criticism. When reading customer reviews,

objectivity is key. Remain calm and seek a positive solution. By

staying focused on damage control and positive interactions,

you can turn most negative reviews into positive learning

experiences for your business, and best of all, even win over new

supporters.
