The Role of Finance

▪ Report to the CEO, but we all work for BB

▪ It’s not only about the numbers: Finance provides a service to the

business

Great analysis won’t do much good, unless you’re prepared to

act on it or persuade others to act on it.

▪ In order to be an effective financial manager, you need proven business skills like

leadership and communication. You need to be able to effectively communicate

about more than just financial matters with people in marketing, research, IT and

other departments. Financial management isn’t just about accounting or internal

audits. As a financial manager, you will have to work with business professionals of

many different disciplines to find solutions to their needs and provide them with the

best tools to do their jobs well.

▪ Financial managers also need to be able to see past the models and metrics and

understand what drives business. It’s not enough to create a model for the product

team/department that helps them negotiate prices and payment terms with

factories. You need to be able to understand how your company as a whole works

in order to become a successful financial manager

The Role of Finance

▪ CFO’s role is not to prevent the business from operating,

but

– CFO’s must report breaches, major issues, etc to BB

– This is not an expectation but part of the role

▪ CFO to be Gatekeeper

▪ Ensure internal controls are maintained

▪ “Police” the OTB

– CEO to be made aware of purchases exceeding the OTB target

– Capex in line with Group principles

BBRC

BBRC

The Role of Finance

▪ Signatories

– Two signatories, proper division of duties

– All CFO’s and Finance Managers are trained to understand

internal controls and the proper authorisation processes that

are required

▪ Reconciliations

– Monthly (never quarterly or half-yearly)

– Outstanding items cleared

– Rhythm

– Stay ahead of issues

▪ Test your teams processes

– Test check invoices (pull a random invoice)

– Sit at your teams desk

BBRC

The Role of Finance

▪ Things to be aware of:

– Duplicate and over payments

– Limit scanning and copying of invoices: it increases the risk of

duplicate payments

– Emailed invoices (increases the risk of duplicate payments)

– Controls over processing invoices: Invoice numbers are

entered into the system to ensure the same invoice cannot be

processed or paid twice

– Deliberate multiple invoicing, fictitious invoices

– When there is an urgent need to have something done (eg

obtain a signature), it means that there is an issue that needs

attention

– Again, test the system, processes and your team regularly

The Role of Finance

▪ Expense reduction vs CODB (as a % of sales)

▪ The cost reduction approach finds ways to improve

earnings by reducing operational store costs or

overhead support – it’s internally focussed.

▪ CODB looks outside the organisation to competitors

and what is happening in other markets.

– Includes new or improved management practices; applying

shared learning and collective experience to improve outputs;

finding efficiency and productivity improvements to dated

processes or methodology.

– How can we do things differently to make us better than last

year.

BBRC

The Role of Finance

▪ Business Improvement Plan

– Identify initiatives from; Strategy days, BBRC Academy’s, CODB opportunities, workshops

and incorporate into the BIP,

– This is not meant to be the accountants taking LY numbers and adjusting them either up or

down.

▪ Read (and then read again) the article from Jack Welch

on Budgeting:

– Leaner is better

– Eliminate bureaucracy

– Cut waste relentlessly

– Operations should be fast and simple

– Value each other’s time

– Invest in infrastructure

– We should know our business best. We don’t need consultants to tell us what to do

▪ Support centre costs are applied to all stores

– Profits after Support centre costs is the only profit measure

– The idea that a new store does not change Support centre costs is delusional and is never

found to be true

BBRC – What’s Important

Forecasts:

▪ Forecasts should reflect the view of business, but if CFO’s

disagree this needs to be highlighted.

▪ Update each month - must do! Should be changing – otherwise

need to answer why not...
