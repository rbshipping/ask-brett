BBRC – What’s Important

Forecasts:

▪ Forecasts should reflect the view of business, but if CFO’s

disagree this needs to be highlighted.

▪ Update each month - must do! Should be changing – otherwise

need to answer why not...

▪ To “look” forward at least 3 months (even at year end!)

▪ Eg, In May of each year – show June, July, August

▪ Cash flow

– Lowest balance each month – minimum of $500k (should also

be documented on KPI page, Actual vs forecast, no more than

$500k. Make use of overdraft for inter-month shortfalls)

– Ensure no “excess” cash left in business

▪ When making distributions: send email or remittance advising all

shareholders – courtesy

OTB:

▪ Excess inventory takes a long time to correct

▪ CFO to act as “devil’s advocate”

▪ Ensure forecasts are debated

▪ CFO’s are Gatekeeper to the business

▪ Buyers must buy to current trend (plus 1% or minus 1%).

▪ Targets based on closing inventory units: simple and easy to understand

▪ Monthly meetings

– Inventory levels: Show Actual vs Target

▪ Weekly follow up to ensure OTB is on track

MBO/QBO reports and Purpose

▪ Reporting works for the Brand not for the MBO report (Board)

– If the business does not use it, raise it with the Board

▪ The Brand sets the Agenda

▪ CEO runs the business – sets the strategy

– The Board either approves or not

▪ There should be no variance between the June MBO and the Statutory

accounts

– No period 13

▪ Business Improvement Plan (BIP) Do not use the term Budget

▪ Waterfall graphs: Actual compared to BIP and LY

MBO/QBO reports and Purpose

▪ Timing

– Flash report: 8 days after month end Make sure this is being

done! It is used for Group consolidation.

– Monthly report: 10 days after month end

▪ Inventory table: compare against 3 months ago

▪ WHS – no longer called OHS (change the title in the report)

▪ If there’s a large variance (against BIP or LY) provide the explanation

▪ Bank covenants to be colour coded – e.g. Bold red vs Green!

Tracey’s tips:

▪ Ten plus one culture commitments and how they are as relevant to the finance

department as they are to the stores, also that they are responsible for living and

breathing them and maintaining the standards above all else.

▪ Training and development of their relevant teams, CFO shouldn’t wait to be told to do

PARS, Appraisals, Salary reviews, and letters of thanks or performance council an

individual. They should have there own yearly schedule that is worked out in conjunction

with the CEO. The importance of everyone taking there leave and no one to have more

then 3 weeks outstanding and why this is good policy.

▪ Keeping there teams motivated and giving thanks.

▪ What expenses are not necessary

▪ How they should monitor and actively get involved in the major tender processes and

what expenses should be put out to tender on a regular bases.

▪ Challenge themselves to set new goals and what can be improved, don’t accept the

status quo. e.g. I believe sanity but out a weekly P/L

▪ Don’t forget that list of things we put together years ago that need to be checked, such as

phone lines, credit cards, data lines. Electricity, fuel cards etc 3 quotes
