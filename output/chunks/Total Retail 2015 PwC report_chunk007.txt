the reasons behind this willingness could

be that consumers have begun to see digital

currencies being used in other sectors, one

of which is the entertainment industry.

For example, according to a February

2014 PwC white paper on Bitcoin, social

gaming company Zynga added Bitcoin as

a payment method for its most popular

games early in 2014. Besides the added

option for its users, the company generated

thousands of media mentions over its

decision, according to the white paper.

Other well-known organizations that made

the jump to accepting Bitcoin in 2014

according to the PwC white paper, include

the Sacramento Kings NBA franchise and

Overstock.com, which reported 840 orders

on its first day of accepting the currency.

Global Department Store Summits in 2010, 2012, and 2014.
