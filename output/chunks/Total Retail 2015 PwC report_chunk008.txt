Global Department Store Summits in 2010, 2012, and 2014.

With online sales surging at the company–cyber sales were up 300%

in 2014 from the previous year on Black Friday (which has now

become a major shopping day in the UK as well as the US)—Forster

cites mobile as one of the company’s biggest opportunities, and

challenges, in the next few years. Says Forster: “We have a customer

base that wants to use mobile, so our job is to make it a good

experience for them. More specifically, a third of our customers use

the iPhone, so we have to make sure we design for this platform.”

Like any good marketer, Forster believes that Selfridge’s needs

to align itself with how customers perceive it. And that means an

omnichannel experience based on products and brands, not siloed

paths to purchase. “We should be using technology to ‘glue things

together’, as mobile is the glue between the digital and in-store

experience. We are working on how to weave mobile into customer

journeys in ways that add value,” Forster says. Possible applications

might include providing more product information or guidance in

store as customers browse, or alerting personal shopping clients

about the latest arrivals that suit their taste. “It’s up to us to make

mobile good enough for customers to want to use it,” he says.
