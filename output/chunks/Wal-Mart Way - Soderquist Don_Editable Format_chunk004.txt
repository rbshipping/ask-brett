From the very beginning, Wal-Mart invested and continues to invest significant capital in the practical application of technology. Many companies have made enormous expenditures in the area of technology, with poor returns. The key to achieving strong returns on investment is to tie all system development and implementation into your most vital business functions. For Wal-Mart, that kept technology focused on customer satisfaction, which has in turn made technological prowess a key competitive advantage for Wal-Mart.

Wal-Mart’s quest for excellence kept us working on the most basic operations in our business. The simple act of getting our merchandise from the supplier’s dock to the store shelf received numerous makeovers, and we made an art of stripping excess cost and waste of any kind from our logistics operations. We ended up revolutionizing supply-chain management for the entire retail industry.

Wal-Mart fostered relationships with suppliers based on openness and trust—again, revolutionizing the way business is done in an entire industry. Every business enterprise involves relationships, whether they are among your own associates, your customers, your suppliers, your board of directors, your shareholders, or your communities. W believe that these relationships must be maintained at the highest level of honesty and candor at all times. Trust relationships ultimately are the basis of any long-term loyalty and create a climate of success for all parties.

Wal-Mart implemented a carefully thought-out and tenacious growth strategy, plowing a large percentage of profits back into the company to aggressively expand into new markets and to equally aggressively revitalize existing stores, clubs, and distribution centers.

Wal-Mart made an early commitment to corporate responsibility. We still believe that it is important to invest back into the communities we serve and into the lives of our customers. We have never done it out of a sense of obligation or in order to get publicity for what we do, but rather because we believed it was the right thing to do and wanted to be instrumental in the growth, well-being, and prosperity of our communities.

As icing on the cake, we not only worked hard—but we had a lot of fun doing it. We never saw the dynamics of work and fun as incompatible. If you’re going to spend a large percentage of your waking hours at work, why not enjoy it? We kept it informal and comfortable with everyone, joked around a little—often at the expense of senior management—and did all we could to create a fun, upbeat environment that would take the drudgery out of the day-to-day routine and provide a positive atmosphere for everyone.

This, in a nutshell, is the Wal-Mart Way. What do you think so far?

Maybe you’re not convinced it is applicable in your organization or company. Maybe you’re not yet persuaded that our success was based on a carefully crafted set of principles but was more a matter of luck and timing. Maybe you’re already completely satisfied with how your organization does things. Maybe you’re overwhelmed by a seemingly endless array of challenges and problems in your company. But, just maybe, you are open to

testing the waters and learning from one company’s experience and story.

The secret of success in life is for a man to be ready for his opportunity when it comes.

—Benjamin Disraeli

Okay, I’ll tell you a secret after all. The principles I share with you in the following pages will dramatically work for you too. I know firsthand, because I was there!

In 1980, I joined Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., as executive vice president and served in several other executive positions until my appointment in early 1988 to vice chairman and chief operating officer. In January 1999 I was promoted to senior vice chairman of the corporation.

For Reflection and Action:

What factors would you say have been most instrumental in your organization’s successes? Your personal success?

What new attitudes and actions do you need to adopt to make your business more successful?

Chapter 1

Growing Dreams

The uncommon man is merely the common man thinking and dreaming of success in larger terms and in more fruitful areas.

—Melvin Powers

Wal-Mart Way Principle #1

Every successful venture begins with a dream that requires determination, passion, and the willingness to grow if it is to be fulfilled.

Once upon a time there was a man, and that man had a dream. In some ways it was an ordinary dream, not so different from the dreams of millions of others. But it was also uncommon as dreams go. It wasn’t to build the tallest building in the world or to build the longest bridge. It wasn’t to make a million dollars before he was thirty years old, or to become the richest man in the world. It wasn’t to bring honor and glory to himself, or to be one of the most recognized men in the world. Nor was it to be the president of the country he loved so much. His dream was really quite simple: he wanted to own his own store.

Well, maybe his dream wasn’t quite that simple. Because he had some very firm ideas on why—and how—he wanted to own a store. His dream was empowered by his desire to:

Serve people well.

Build a winning team.

Work hard.

Impact people’s lives for good.

Have fun.

Support his family.

Honor his Lord.

But what made this man’s dream extraordinary—and grow beyond his or anyone else’s wildest expectations—was that he cultivated it with a personal commitment to learn, to grow, to accomplish in one lifetime all that he could. One day at a time and every day.

That man’s name was Sam Walton, and so the dream began.

He bought his own store—a small variety store.

He found a supplier of merchandise—Ben Franklin.

He worked really, really hard.

He had fun and created excitement wherever he went.

He touched people’s lives.

He treated people well.
