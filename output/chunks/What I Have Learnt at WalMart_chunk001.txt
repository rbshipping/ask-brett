[Document: What I Have Learnt at WalMart.ppt]
[Presentation Topic: Measuring & Accountability at Walmart]

[Slide 2]

I learned that Wal-Mart measure everything, not to put too fine a point,

I mean everything, this was told to me by every single leader at Wal-Mart, (or the skeptical amongst you, they each presented at different times and it came out in different ways.) The response was uniformly we measure everything and always have.

[Slide 3]

I was reminded that measuring everything is the easiest part, actually

holding people accountable to doing something with that measurement, to ensure that the business improves is the key to measuring, the only reason anything should be measured.

[Slide 4]

I learned that Wal-Mart hold all of their people accountable – not only at

unit level but at every level.

[Slide 5]

I learned that Wal-Mart measures the morale and spirit of all employees

and then they find a way to impact that measure positively

[Slide 6]

I learned that the fastest growing supermarket chain in Chile (which wasn’t Wal-Mart) has every senior manager visit a store every day! I was reminded that there would be no coincidence between those

visits and the fact that they are the most successful outfit in Chile.

[Slide 7]

I learned that all retail divisions must make it policy to do seventeen store visits a month in at least three different states, for all retail management, and then obsessively support that policy.

[Slide 8]

I was reminded again that character, capacity and capabilities is critical not experience. I learned that is true in a 1.8 million employee organisation like Wal-Mart as it is in a single store.0

[Slide 9]

I learned that we buy for the customer we don’t sell to the customer; I learned that buyers and retailer organisations have trouble understanding this and we should repeat this again and again – our job is to buy for the customer not to sell to the customer.

[Slide 10]

I was reminded again that all organisations have a culture and you’re either going to orchestrate your culture or it will grow on its own.

[Slide 11]

I learned that for organisations and the executives who lead them the hardest

thing is to decide which bridge to build and which to burn.

[Slide 12]

I was reminded that change brings fear

[Slide 13]

I was reminded that change must happen; but not to ‘bet the farm’..

[Slide 14]

I was reminded that change requires vision, evaluation, courage and risk-taking.

[Slide 15]

I was reminded the one thing you never change is your core values. You can change what you do, you can change how you do it but you cannot change your core values.

[Slide 16]

I learned that change will not succeed unless you’re open and listening,

communicating, determined to make a change succeed and that the whole team is working towards the required change.

[Slide 17]

I was reminded that our suppliers, our crew and customers must have the ability to safely reach up in the organisation without fear or retribution.

[Slide 18]

I learned that Wal-Mart with 1.8 million employees has a people asset review on all its crew on a monthly basis. (That shamed and inspired me all at once!) A startling reality that we will have a monthly board

meeting, a monthly property meeting, an IT steering committee meeting, MBR’s etc yet the most important asset that we have is our people and we do not have any concept, mechanism, process or meeting at even the Macro level, regarding our people, yet Wal-Mart assess all monthly; our best is to make claim to have a one on one appraisal annually – that was a stunning realisation.

I learned that Lee Scott, the head of the most successful retail

organisation in the world, believes his leadership style is by erosion i.e. he keeps asking and he keeps asking. That he is a servant leader.

[Slide 20]

I learned that there are only two reasons why you should change

(1) For our customers (2) For our people – anything else is probably

for the wrong reason.

[Slide 21]

I was reminded that communication is always important and that we should always ‘tell’ what we are working on.

[Slide 22]

I learned that is it time for a new word and to re-symbolize “service” – in the past we gave ‘customer service’ and now provide ‘customer satisfaction’ – we need to re-culture and give ‘perfect service’.

[Slide 23]

I learned that one day a week all management who work in the Wal-Mart DC work “on the line” and I mean – all management, every week, “on the line’.
