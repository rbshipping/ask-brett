life. It is easy, for example, for a front-lines employee or someone who works in a highly technical

field to discount criticism from a boss who has never worked customer service, or lacks the technical

expertise of the employee. Similarly, a parent may feel that a nonparent can never understand the

time-management challenges of working while raising children.

A major factor in how people will respond to feedback is how competent they are at their jobs.

This relates to the well-known Dunning-Kruger effect, according to which ‘‘the expertise necessary to

judge a person’s performance in many domains is exactly the same expertise needed to produce

competent performance in the first place.’’12 In other words, poor performers often fail to realize their

own incompetence, and even rate themselves highest on the domains in which they score the worst.

Hence, in the workplace, those who need feedback the most often benefit from it the least. Low

performers show very little interest in feedback and are likely to disparage negative criticism in

whatever way they can, calling into question the accuracy or relevance of the feedback. Because poor

performers fail to recognize their own incompetence, they may interpret neutral or mildly positive

feedback as negative------with all the attendant problems that come along with negative feedback------if

their own image of their performance was higher.

Assuming a baseline of competence, motivational factors can also play a major role in feedback

interactions. Within the feedback literature, a considerable amount of research has been done on how

people relate to goals, differentiating two major approaches: “a learning goal orientation, whereby

individuals focus on improving their capabilities and mastering challenging situations by learning

new skills or new things, and a performance goal orientation, whereby an individual demonstrates

competence, receives recognition for accomplishments, and avoids negative feedback about his/her

competence or performance.”13 The performance goal orientation can be focused primarily on

proving the self in a positive way, or on avoiding negative feedback. For the most part, employees

focused on learning tend to go to greater lengths to seek feedback, approaching people with

experience in the area in which they are looking to gain expertise, rather than individuals with power

in the organization.14 In contrast, people whose main aim it is to prove their ability are less likely to

seek feedback, and when (if) they do, they are more likely to approach people with power rather than

those with experience in the task at hand.15 The learning orientation also goes along with using

feedback more effectively. Employees who are motivated more by internal factors (intellectual challenge,

the satisfaction of accomplishment) also seek and use feedback more effectively than workers who

are primarily motivated by external rewards such as money and status.16

Relatedly, an individual’s beliefs about change have a strong impact on how that person will

respond to feedback. Part of the learning orientation, for example, is the belief that change is possible,

that improvement happens incrementally, and that effort pays off. An employee with these beliefs

will have reason to use feedback to improve, whereas a person who believes “You either got it or you

don’t,” upon finding out that he “don’t,” will see no reason to invest extra effort.17

Beliefs about change are to some extent individual or culturally learned18 (Asians, for example, are

more likely to attribute outstanding performance to effort and practice, while Westerners attribute it

to native talent), but organizational factors matter here as well. An employee high in organizational

cynicism, or the belief that effort will not be rewarded nor support given for development, will be
