that includes appearance, especially of the face and hair, and also wellness of skin and body. They

expect the most advanced technologies, constantly improved efficacy, and also the latest in colors,

forms, and styles.

Apparel. Women want apparel to do a lot of work for them—make them look and feel good,

minimize what they consider their physical shortcomings, make the right statement at work, be

comfortable, and let them express their personal style.

Financial services. In most households women handle the finances, and the majority of women say

they dislike the job. Financial products are confusing and complicated. Financial advisers are

predominantly male. Women typically pay more for insurance than men do and have compensation

and retirement packages that are not as good as men’s.

Healthcare. Women generally like their doctors and the care they receive from them but are not

pleased with the delivery systems in which their doctors must work. Too little access. Too much

waiting. Not enough contact. Billing and management processes that are far too complex.

In this book, we examine these areas and describe companies that are leading the way in each

area—and how they are doing so. Perhaps even more important, we provide you with firsthand

observations and insights from a number of women we met in the course of our research whose

engagement and intelligence speak more clearly than we ever could about what women truly want

and how they are exercising their buying power as never before.
