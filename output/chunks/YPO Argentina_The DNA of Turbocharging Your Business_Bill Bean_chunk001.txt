The “DNA” of Turbocharging Your Business

I. Ten Turbocharging Principles

1. The Principle of Convergence

e The Turbocharging process is analogous to nature’s cycle.

® The cloud and reservoir water do no good unless they reach the

growing fields!

Steps of Turbocharging

1, Strategic Assessment

Water needs first to be

collected in one place,

2, Values

then a channel to reach the 3. Vision

fields, and then needs to be 4. External Analysis

regularly distributed across

them in order to make

produce grow. Leadership

teams need to analyze key

strategic aspects to form

one plan with goal

priorities, and to set and

complete action plans,

which are tracked by

monthly implementation

meetings, so that results

are made across the

business.

2, The Principle of Simplification

© Strategic Planning should be simplified in concept: “Plan and DO”

e — Turbocharging is certainly not “rocket science,” but it is rocket fuel!

“Set” Results “Achieve” Results

Business (e.g,, Invstmt., Invty. turn, HR)

Customers (¢.g., On-time delivery).

Other (e.g., Safety, # Incid., Lost time).

Meet / exceed targets.

Clear, provable, measured!

“Select” Goals “ull” Goais

Major company priorities. “Nail” the priorities you set.

Major programs, projects, etc.! Implement your plan priorities.

“Schedule” Action Plans “Complete” Action Plans

Specific. On time.

Time-bounded, Thoroughly done.

Person-responsible. Fully impactful.

Measurable. Human accountability.

Achievable.

THE GOAL: Simplification!

3, The Principle of Accu-Speed

e This graphic shows that “accurate speed” is achieved by performing what

Col. John Boyd (Marines) calls the O-O-D-A Loop faster than others.

e You gain the benefit of attaining a sharper turning radius.

e This even allows you more trial and error-—ultimately giving you the

competitive edge.

e Not “ready-fire-aim” or “ready-aim-aim-aim” but “ready-aim-fire-faster.”

5. The Principle of Alignment

e Effective communication is often identified as one of the least effective

traits in an organization.

e There are those who have information (owners) and those who use

information (users).

° The principle of “NO VICTIMS” ~ if you need information ask and get it;

if you have information, consider who needs it and send it to them!

© The following chart shows that communications is a matter of alignment.

6. The Principle of Deployment

e Approximately 10 goals are selected for anew year.

e Leadership has 3 leverage tools to synchronize (hence, choreograph)

plan implementation.

~— The priority you have given a goal.

— The month you elect to start, the span, and the targeted end-date.

— The resources that you give to each goal in each month.
