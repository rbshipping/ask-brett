2. SF SWOT Exercise

Directions: Identify key lists for the following categories of this “Strategic SF SWOT” form.

Definition: SF = The Successes and Failures that have happened in the enterprise during the last year or

50, COMPANIES NEED MORE THAN “SWOT” ANALYSIS! WHAT ABOUT THE PAST? THAT 1s

WHY WE ADD 2 CATEGORIES. Question: What have you attempted to do in the business over the past

year that either was successful (you accomplished what you were aiming for) or was unsuccessful (you did

not meet your expectations), hence failures, or at the least, you “can do better?”

SUCCESSES (Past Positive Actions)

. .

FAILURES (Past Negative Actions)

e .

. .

Definition: SW = The Strengths and Weaknesses of the organization. Here we are not looking at events

but current conditions, characteristics. Like a financial balance sheet, this measures the various “assets” and

“tjabilities” of the organization as it exists at this present time. Question: What resources, personnel, unique

market advantages, products, services, and so forth, are a part of your business situation and are either

strengths (which you can build with) or weaknesses (which you can strengthen or resolve)?

STRENGTHS (Present Positive Conditions)

Definition: OT = The Opportunities and the ‘Threats that confront the organization. Here we are

looking into the future. These are factors that are not really under your control but must still be taken into

account as you develop your strategy. Question: What factors or conditions of your business environment

pose opportunities (which you can take advantage or capitalize on) or threats (which must either be

transformed into opportunities or be avoided by the enterprise)?
