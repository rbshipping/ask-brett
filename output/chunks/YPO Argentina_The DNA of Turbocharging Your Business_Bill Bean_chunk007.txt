3. Key Monthly Meeting Element #2: Monthly Action Plans:

Tracking, Updating, and Adding New Ones

Summary of How To Do Action Plans’ Review:

We have covered how goals are converted into action plans.

Then the monthly meeting is set up and you start having them!

All the action plans that have come due over the past calendar month are

then reviewed in a given month.

As Action Plans are completed month to month, goals are gradually

achieved!

raised and posted on the Parking Lot page earlier). Post a

list of items. Then “mini-agenda” them and work through

them as shown below.
