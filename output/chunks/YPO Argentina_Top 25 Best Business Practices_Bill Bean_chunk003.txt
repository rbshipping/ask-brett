A. Two Governing Principles

1. The Principle of Convergence

e The Turbocharging process is analogous to nature’s cycle.

e The cloud and reservoir water do no good unless they reach the

growing fields!

Water needs first to be

collected in one place,

then a channel to reach the

fields, and then needs to be

regularly distributed across

them in order to make

produce grow. Leadership

teams need to analyze key

strategic aspects to form

one plan with goal

priorities, and to set and

complete action plans,

which are tracked by

monthly implementation

meetings, so that results

are made across the

business.

2. The Principle of Simplification

e _ Strategic Planning should be simplified in concept: “Plan and DO”!

© _ Turbocharging is certainly not “rocket science,” but it is rocket fuel!

“Set” Results

® Financial (e.g., sales, GM, profits).

© Business (e.g., Invstmt., Invty turn, HR).

© Customers (e.g., On-time delivery).

Other (e.g, Safety, # Incid, Lost time).

“Achieve” Results

© Meet / exceed targets.

© Clear, provable, measured!

“Fulfill” Goals

¢ “Nail” the priorities you set.

* Implement your plan priorities.

“Select” Goals

© Major company priorities.

© Major programs, projects, etc.!

“Schedule” Action Plans

© Specific.

° Time-bounded.

¢ Person-responsible.

¢ Measurable.

Achievable.

“Complete” Action Plans

* On time.

e Thoroughly done.

° Fully impactful.

e¢ Human accountability.

THE GOAL: Simplification!

B. The Master Practice — Choreograph Your Deployment

These blocks

show the amount

of resources

(height of blocks:

e.g., number of

people assigned,

etc.) and duration

(width of blocks)

of the project.

Notes:

e Approximately 10 goals are selected for a new year.

e Leadership has 3 leverage tools to synchronize (hence, choreograph)

plan implementation.

~ The priority you have given a goal.

— The month you elect to start, the span, and the targeted end-date.

— The resources that you give to each goal in each month.

C. The Secret: Systematic Conversion From Each Goal Into Action

Plans

The following is an example of how to convert a goal into action plans, followed by

a blank form for your use in your company. Please note that the next Best Practice

(IL. D.) details the key components needed in order to make great action plans.

D. Elements of a Complete Action Plan

e The purpose of Action Plans is to implement the goal!

e Completed, effective action plans achieve the goals and produce the results.

© The Action Plan has 4 absolutely critical parts;

a) @ @ ©

Philippines Graham

qa) A/P#: The Action Plans’ number system:

— Typically an “alpha” tag of 3 letters, with a number, (01, 02,

03, ete.).

~ Examples: PUR for Purchasing, FIN for Financial, ENG for

Engineering, SAL for Sales, etc.

— So the first action plan for Purchasing is PUR-O1.

— For every new action plan that comes during the year add Pur-02,

Pur-03, Pur-04, etc.

Action Plan Description should be succinct, clear, simple, strong action to

achieve goal. .

Responsible: the asterisk (*) is that if more than one name, there must always

be one person accountable, designated by the asterisk.

OOo

The Due-Dates and Actual Dates: The Due Date as (mm/dd/yy) establishes a

“stroke of midnight” accountability for time lines. The Actual Date is when it’s

done!

e Lessons:

_ A slid Due-Date counts as a “late” and hurts goal progress.

— The manager should know well in advance if an item is late.

— Asurprise is a process failure.

~ These action plans . strategic plan duties must be tied into his ¢ her

performance appraisal, weighted along vide daily operation tasks.
