E. The Effective Implementation Rule

| The Principle of Maximum Reasonable Stretch: |

e Younever want “sand-bagging” where they are not giving their best.

e You never want heroic over-commitment where someone wants to do it sooner

but cannot given other workloads or complexities.

© $0 Maximum Reasonable Stretch means the persons responsible are stretching

out of their comfort zone but still have a very high (80%) or more sense oF

confidence factor, that it will be done well by the due-date.

e The Golden Benchmark is

— 80% or more of all action plans should be completed on-time or early fora

given month and Year-to-Date.

— 80% isa challenge, but the best-disciplined companies do it!

— A reschedule is a miss unless it was absolutely due to an outside factor he /

she 100% could not have controlled / anticipated.

—_ Institutionalize this principle and this measure by making it one of your key

indicator / balanced, scorecard / dashboard items.

A. Three Practical Principles

1. The Principle of Acceleration

2. The Principle of Accu-Speed

e This graphic shows that “accurate speed” is achieved by performing what

Col, John Boyd (Marines) calls the O-O-D-A Loop faster than others.

e You gain the benefit of attaining a sharper turning radius.

e This even allows you more trial and error-—ultimately giving you the

competitive edge.

e Not “ready-fire-aim” or “ready-aim-aim-aim” but “ready-aim-fire-faster.”

3. The Principle of Alignment

e Effective communication is often identified as one of the least effective

traits in an organization.

© There are those who have information (owners) and those who use

information (users).

© The principle of “NO VIC’ TIMS” — if you need information ask and get it;

if you have information, consider who needs it and send it to them!

e The following chart shows that communications is a matter of alignment.

B. The Master Practice: The Monthly Strategic Implementation

Plans are done well and on time.

Meeting.

2, Setting the Monthly Meeting Time and Schedule:

a. Week of Month: (e.g., third week of month).

b. Day of Week: (e.g., Monday of that week).

ee

c. Start Time: am / pm

d. Block Until: am / pm

Note: This is so no one leaves a meeting prematurely in

the event a meeting goes longer than usual,

e. 2006/2007 Schedule: (List meeting dates month by month.)

f itis very important for attendees to book these meetings far in advance in

order to not miss one. Aifendance should be mandatory. It is your most

important meeting! People can cail in from the road via speaker phone.
