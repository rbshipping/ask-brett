E. Key Element #3: Converting New-News / Parking Lot Items into

Action Plans:

1. As-we have covered, the Monthly Strategic Implementation

Meeting — The Tracking Meeting for your strategic business

plan, has three parts on the agenda:

a. Key Indicator Measurements [covered].

b. Monthly Action Plans Tracking [covered].

c. New-News / Parking Lot [here].

2. For this section, at the end of the meeting go around the room

and ask each Leader if they have a New-News item that they

have held until now (if it has not already been raised and posted

on the Parking Lot page earlier). Post a list of items. Then

“mini-agenda” them and work through them as shown below.

3. New Matters / Address New Issues Summary:

IV. Leading

A. A Critical Lever — Make Resource Decisive Actions Fast Enough

© One of the greatest challenges CEO’s have faced is the timely address of non-

performers.

— Identify and put the non-performers on a measured-mile as soon as

necessary.

— With no improvement over those 30 — 90 days, if there is no other role for

them to move to, move them out. It is best for all parties.

© Turbocharge hiring right persons in Key Roles. Get them on the bus in the right

seat ASAP. It is delays and open holes that are costly!

© Get a #2 Person / COO sooner than later if you don’t have one and need it.
