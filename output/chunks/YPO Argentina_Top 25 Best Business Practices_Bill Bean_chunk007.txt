V. Optimizing

A. A Key to Utilization — The Principle of “Highest and Best Use.”

e “What is my highest and best use as President / CEO / Chairman?”

e “What is each of my Direct Reports’ highest and best use in / for the company?”

e “How can I and my direct reports practically achieve highest and best use by the

following action(s)?”

Who? What? When? How?

~ Educate?

— Delegate?

- Eliminate?

Ce a te tt I I

— Truncate?

eg tt tN

— Automate? Or...

~ Resource?

— Qutsource?

e Your Direct Reports should do this same exercise with their Direct Reports and

so on down the organization.

e The key is: once you have determined “Highest and Best Use”:

— Define what you are doing today.

— Develop specific tasks that must be changed.

~ How do you systematically shift vour tasks and time to daily perform

consistently in the right “mix” of your “Highest and Best L'se™ roles?

B. The Principle of “Return On Energy.”

© We have been educated on the need to achieve various key “returns”:

— Return On Investment (ROI).

— Return On Assets (ROA).

— Return On Equity (ROE), and others.

e But what about that irrecoverable and most precious resource ~ energy and

Return on Energy “ROEN”?

® Since you and your leadership team’s time is extremely valuable.

e And increasing factors and pressures tug for your scarce “ergs of energy”...

e Allocation of those “ergs of energy” is the key.

e The Return On Energy Quadrants:

(The Golden

Opportunities —

Exploit Them!)

Low Energy

very productive. because you gain momentum within each task.
