E. “2-Minute Drills” - The Most Valuable and Efficient

Communications and Team-Building Tool That We Know Of.

e The Essence: The 2-Minute Drill is an e-mail that each management

team member (you, your direct reports, any others you select) type in

5 to 10 minutes and e-mail to the “Management Distribution” list,

e The key is to e-mail them every week by no later than 2pm Friday.

Why? People can read / take them before the weekend.

e You can highlight (‘“bold” the line item) any items you deem very

important. Some of my clients review the highlighted bold items in a

quick 15-minute meeting the following Monday morning.

e The following are key characteristics of the 2-Minute Drills:

~ Purpose: everyone communicate his / her key highlights.

— Frequency: weekly, by 2pm each Friday.

— Distribution: CEO, Direct Reports / any others: all e-mail each

other.

~ Means: E-mail to your “2MD” distribution list.

— Time: takes about 5 to 10 minutes to write / send and 2 minutes to

read each one.

— Benefits:

— Dramatically improves communications and teamwork.

— Build company / “generalist / not just one’s own

department / functional” perspective.
