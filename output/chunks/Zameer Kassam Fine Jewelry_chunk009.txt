having a persistent record, explained step-by-step in their inbox, and with more detail than was

contained in this sketchpad alone, may have helped the client come to a decision more quickly.

Still, Kassam wondered what was being lost. For example, Kassam shuddered when he thought of

aclient unboxing a ring ina place with poor lighting. “That moment, when you see this incredible piece

of jewelry that you built with us, and because of the lighting it doesn’t take your breath away. We can

control that in our environment.” Kassam elaborated, “I have been surprised to see the business grow

during the pandemic, and while clients aren’t complaining, I worry our service level is diminishing. I

worry we're engaging less with our clients, and I worry that my team is feeling less satisfaction from

engaging less with them.” For example, during celebrations, Kassam had noticed that fewer brides and

grooms-to-be cried when it was conducted online. “It’s an odd metric to look at, but I've always felt

that if we can get that kind of emotional connection from someone in a meeting like this, then we've

“During COVID, this has changed, as people are more comfortable online, and seem to be in a more

reflective place. I believe there are many more people who want what we have to offer, and so what

felt like a major concern in the beginning of the pandemic now feels like it could be an opportunity.

But that's my question... When we go back to a new world, will this in-person magic still be the secret

sauce? Or will some of what we've learned during the pandemic actually build a much more scalable

business?”

As Kassam closed his sketchbook, feeling the weight of the thousands of love stories told in its

pages, he knew that the answers to these questions would define not just his company, but his future.

He picked up his favorite pencil, opened a new sketchbook, and knew it was time to write the next

chapter of his own story.
