@nytimes article, a closer look at

Louis's engagement ring for Kate: Louis

Met Kate In 2014, which is celebrated

through the numbers of diamonds set

into platinum shoulders, which lead

towards the perfectly cut round

diamond in the center. It was at the

Frost Library at @amherstcollege

where Louis gathered the courage to

‘speak to her, which we symbolized by

hand-carving the exact brickwork of

the library into the platinum after the

After secretly meeting with Jeff for months, we finally

got to celebrate the beautiful proposal with Monika

and friends. It was a night of celebration, dancing and

building memories. It was such an honor to create a

ring that secretly tells your love story, Jeff Zeller &

Monika Niedzwiedzka! Let the celebrations continue!

zameerkassam Like any love story, details matter. When Jeff

shared Monika’s love of planes, it wasn’t just about traveling

(though she loves to travel too). It was about her life as a

young woman in Poland, the only daughter, embarking on a

wild and crazy journey of professional fulfillment that would

take her far from home at an early age. We researched many

(mostly @british_airways) flight paths and found archival

footage of many (mostly @boeing) planes, but ultimately, we

chose to include the #Dreamliner, because it was on this

plane that Monika and Jeff flew to Poland to meet her family

for the first time. Thankfully, there are plenty of images

available online, and so we began to sketch, not knowing

then where this plane would land on the ring. Ultimately, we

chose to hide it within the shape of the prongs under the

diamond. Sadly, this meant we had to minimize the plane's

details (minimal metal is a crucial part of our aesthetic).
