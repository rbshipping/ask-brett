Stock in Drawers

Stock in drawers is not efficient

Stock in drawers also stays in drawers a lot of the time and is not countable, leads to missed sales.

Adds a tremendous amount of time to stocktaking.

[Slide 16]

Solutions stock in Drawers

A process where the only stock in drawers is stock that has run it's time and will be a markdown

When it comes off the wall sticker with its markdown price at that time and then left in drawer until clearance time.

Other thoughts

What's on your mind

[Slide 31]

We Don’t Sell Fashion

The product team is thinking in terms of ‘fashion’ in our ranges

We should be thinking about the customer – their wants and needs

We need the thinking to be about the emotion we are selling

What job is this product hired by our customer to do?

What is our customer buying this for?

We must train ourselves to look behind the answer of “she wants to look or feel good”

Why does she want to look good?

What is the emotional driver?

[Slide 32]

Emotional capital:

What is the emotion we are selling?

What is the emotional experience that we are helping to deliver?

We Don’t Sell Fashion

[Slide 33]

Emotional capital:

What is the emotion we are selling?

What is the emotional experience that we are helping to deliver?

We Don’t Sell Fashion

[Slide 34]

This also applies to our windows and in store merchandising material

We must continue to get better at the connection to the emotion behind our product.

Representing the emotion behind the range , if we can, as simply and creativity as we possibly can i.e. carnival session is not about spring and horse racing, it’s about:

Looking better than the other girls

Being noticed

Finding love, passion, husband, boy, sex, etc

Getting glammed up, smashed

laughing
