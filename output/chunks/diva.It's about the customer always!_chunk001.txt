CULTURE

Why is the company culture so important?

A culture is set of values that are important to our success, a way of operating that makes the difference between effective and mediocre performance.

The culture is an essential standard for behaviour and direction – when one is in place, it replaces rules, ensures empowerment of team members, and guides people in their decision-making.

[Slide 16]

THE CULTURE’S AFFECT

How does the culture affect the way we carry out our jobs?

Determines how we work together

Determines how team members will treat each other

Determines the attitudes that bind us all together

It creates consistency

Provides stability in an environment that is constantly changing

Empowers team, replacing the need for rules

Guides people in their decision making
