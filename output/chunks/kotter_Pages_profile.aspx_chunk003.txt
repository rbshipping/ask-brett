The Konosuke Matsushita Professor of Leadership, Emeritus at the Harvard Business School and a graduate of MIT and Harvard, Kotter’s vast experience and knowledge on successful change and leadership have been proven time and again.

John Kotter’s articles in The Harvard Business Review over the past twenty years have sold more reprints than any of the hundreds of distinguished authors who have written for that publication during the same time period. Kotter has been on the Harvard Business School faculty since 1972. In 1980, at the age of 33, he was given tenure and a full professorship, making him one of the youngest people in the history of the University to be so honored.

Professor Kotter's article "Accelerate!" in the Harvard Business Review—in which he first debuted his Dual Operating System business model—won the 2012 McKinsey Award, recognizing it as the most significant article published in the magazine that year. This article has since been expanded into a full book by the same name.

Professor Kotter is the 2009 recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award by ASTD (American Society for Training & Development). This award was presented in recognition of his extensive body of work and the significant impact he has had on learning and performance in organizations.

What People Are Saying About Dr. Kotter:

"Your talk was instrumental in helping me raise the leadership bar."

"You clearly sneaked under the defenses of even the most skeptical of our people and established memorable reference points which will be cited repeatedly in the future.  More importantly, you delivered reinforcement, hope and direction for their pursued leadership development aspirations.”

This was a quite uplifting and inspirational experience for me - delivered by one of the finest teachers I have ever seen. I will not forget this one.
