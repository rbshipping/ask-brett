# Buy-In

#### by Dr. John Kotter and Lorne A. Whitehead

This is not a book about persuasion and communication in general, or even about all the useful methods people use to create buy-in. Instead, Dr. Kotter offers a single method that can be unusually powerful in building strong support for a good idea. We have seen that this approach can not only keep good ideas from getting shot down, but can actually turn attacks to your advantage, capturing busy peoples’ attention to help them grasp an idea, and ultimately building strong buy-in.
