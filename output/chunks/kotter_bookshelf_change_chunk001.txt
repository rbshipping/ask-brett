### HOW ORGANIZATIONS ACHIEVE HARD-TO-IMAGINE RESULTS IN UNCERTAIN AND VOLATILE TIMES

#### by John P. Kotter, Vanessa Akhtar, and Gaurav Gupta

There is a growing gap between the rate, amount, and complexity of change in the world, and the ability of the modern enterprise (and the individuals within them) to keep up. This gap presents both a threat and an opportunity. Change shares the emerging science of change that can teach us much about how to build organizations that are more agile and able to change more rapidly.

> "”Like their approach to consulting, the book makes the complex challenge of leading change accessible. It boils down the ‘theory of change’ into common sense advice that is actionable and relevant—no matter if you are changing strategy, reconsidering structure, or simply trying to adapt at the speed of today’s change. As we prepare for a post Covid world, never has there been a time when harnessing the imagination and energy of employees has been more critical for companies that want to thrive in an environment that may look completely different than a year ago. This marvelous book can help companies prepare for this massive challenge…and opportunity. —Jessica DeVliegerGlobal CEO, C-Space"

> "”Different from other books on change, the focus is on three broad sets of critical influencing factors: human behavior hard wiring (to survive and/or thrive), modern organizational structures and how they undercut change, and the notion that leadership can come from everywhere and not just the top. It beautifully captures how almost everyone approaches change today, i.e., top down and metrics driven, as well as a research and experience based (vastly better) alternative. The “dual system” idea is clever and greatly needed because we must have both the reliability, efficiency, and scale afforded by modern organizational structures and the adaptability, agility, and flexibility afforded by fluid networks. —Peter KimVice President, Thermo Fisher Scientific"
