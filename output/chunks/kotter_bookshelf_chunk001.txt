##### Featured Book

### Order your copies of Change today.

## There is a growing gap between the rate, amount, and complexity of change in the world, and the ability of the modern enterprise (and the individuals within them) to keep up. This gap presents both a threat and an opportunity. CHANGE shares the science of change that can teach us much about how to build organizations that are more agile and able to change more rapidly.

##### 8-Steps For Leading Change

### The Framework

Over four decades, Dr. Kotter observed countless leaders and organizations as they were trying to transform or execute their strategies. He identified and extracted the common success factors and documented them as the 8 Steps for Leading Change.

Since the introduction of the 8 Steps, Dr. Kotter expanded his focus from research to impact with the founding of Kotter. Together with the firm, he evolved the linear 8 Step from Leading Change to the 8 Accelerators outlined in his 2014 book,  Accelerate and the firm’s 2021 book, CHANGE.

##### The 4 Core Change Principles

### The Power of “+”

The 4 Core Change Principles emerged directly from our work with clients as fundamental tenets for how to unlock the full power of the 8 Steps. They were first documented in Dr. Kotter’s Harvard Business Review article, Accelerate!

When used as a litmus test for every decision and every action, the Principles are the key to enabling a more adaptable organization.
