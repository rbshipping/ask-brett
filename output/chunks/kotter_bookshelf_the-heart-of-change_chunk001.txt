# The Heart of Change

#### by Dr. John Kotter and Dan S. Cohen

In The Heart of Change, the authors have culled from hundreds of interviews the 34 most instructive and vivid accounts of companies undergoing large-scale change. With chapters organized by each of the eight stages of change Kotter identified in Dr. John Kotter’s 1996 bestseller Leading Change, the authors deftly contrast success stories with fumbles, then utilize the compare-and-contrast format for lively “how-to/how-not-to” discussion.
