All crises offers opportunities. And right now, I suspect we’re going to find, not only some companies struggling in the short term, even more so and this is what you too have written about. They’re going to drive themselves inadvertently and their workforces, so deeply into a panic induced down, that no innovation is going to happen over the next six months or two years. And when the recession begins to let up, and there’s an opportunity to really grow once again, they’re going to be positioned terribly because again, no innovation during the interim. This is a, I mean, it’s a bit bizarre or awkward or creepy to talk about opportunity in a situation in which death is a daily reality right now, but the truth is we’re going to see some big differences in terms of how well companies handle and make decisions that either go with a realistic understanding of human nature and position them better in the short term in the long term, or go with a not scientific understanding of human nature and inadvertently really get themselves in trouble.
