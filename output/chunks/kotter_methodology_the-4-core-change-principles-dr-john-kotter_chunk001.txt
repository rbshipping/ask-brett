============================================================

### Our Foundation

# The 4 Core Change Principles

Kotter’s award-winning methodology is the proven approach to producing lasting change.

# The Power of "+"

The 4 Core Change Principles emerged directly from our work with clients as fundamental tenets for how to unlock the full power of the 8 Steps. They were first documented in Dr. Kotter’s Harvard Business Review article, Accelerate!

When used as a litmus test for every decision and every action, the Principles are the key to enabling a more adaptable organization.

## MANAGEMENT + LEADERSHIP

In order to capitalize on windows of opportunity that might open and close quickly, the name of the game is leadership, and not just from one executive. It’s about vision, opportunity, motivating action, and celebration – in addition to the essential managerial processes like project management, budget reviews, and reporting. By combining the stability and predictability anchored by management with the speed and innovation inspired by leadership, organizations can move faster and with more reliability.

## HEAD + HEART

Data and reason underpin many good ideas. But most people won’t be inspired to help you if you appeal to logic alone. You must also consider how people feel – speak to the genuine and fundamental human desire to contribute to a bigger cause, to take an organization or community into a better future. Answer the questions burning in people’s minds: “What’s in it for me?” and “In service of what?” Give them a reason to believe.

## HAVE TO + WANT TO

People who feel they have the opportunity to be involved in an important activity will volunteer to do so… in addition to their normal responsibilities. You don’t have to hire new people; your existing people provide the energy – if you invite them and create an environment where they feel they “get to” step forward and act. After all, it is your people who know where the pain points are and how to fix them.

## SELECT FEW + DIVERSE MANY

Certain tasks can and should be accomplished by a specific group of experts. But change that requires many people to do things differently can’t sit on the shoulders of a select few. You need more eyes to see, more brains to think, and more hands and feet to act. More people need to be able to make change happen – not just carry out someone else’s directives. Done right, this uncovers leaders at all levels of the organization – not just the usual suspects.
